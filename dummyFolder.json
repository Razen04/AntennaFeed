Initially, the files aren’t actually deleted, even though they disappear from view. They’re kept around in what is called the Trash, just in case you ever need them back, and then are wiped automatically after a certain amount of time. However, if you’re dealing with sensitive information or selling your device, you can also permanently erase them. </p>\n<p id=\"lTInbx\">ChromeOS, the operating system behind Chromebooks, actually gives you two file systems to think about: one in the cloud (in other words, Google Drive) and one that is local. Each of these systems handles deleted files slightly differently. And note that there’s no syncing between the trash folder for local files...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24195066/chromeos-chromebook-files-delete-how-to\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>"

That’s according to a new <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/urban-heat-islands-2024\">study</a> by the nonprofit Climate Central, which mapped the impact of a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect in major cities in the US.</p>\n<p id=\"qe3Juf\">Dark, paved surfaces with little greenery tend to absorb heat. Hot exhaust from heavy traffic and industrial facilities can also make certain neighborhoods warmer than others. That’s how the urban heat island effect can make a heatwave feel even worse for some communities. In the US, a history of segregation and <a href=\"https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/\">redlining</a> that resulted in chronic underinvestment <a href=\"https://grist.org/justice/extreme-heat-redlining-portland/\">in many neighborhoods of color</a> also <a href=\"https://heat.brown.columbia.edu/\">created heat islands in cities</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"wFz26b\">It’s a problem that often flies under the radar because a typical weather forecast for a city misses these hyperlocal nuances. To get a better picture of how heat impacts a city from neighborhood to neighborhood, Climate Central documented the urban heat island effect down to a more granular level. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"8afE7E\"><q>“When you look across the country, this is everywhere.”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"ooUZA3\">“When you look across the country, this is everywhere. This is not a big city problem. This is a big development problem. And that can happen anywhere,” says Climate Central senior data analyst and research manager Jennifer Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"I704LH\">Brady and her team scrutinized 37,094 census block groups in the US. A single block group might be home to between 600 to 3,000 residents, an even smaller range than a census tract. “The finer and finer detail you can get, the more accurate the estimates are going to be because what we’re looking at are <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/93/12/bams-d-11-00019.1.xml#i1520-0477-93-12-1879-t02\">land cover type</a>,” Brady says. </p>\n<p id=\"NwBZoC\">They compared maps of those census block groups with an existing <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database\">National Land Cover Database</a> to assess what the makeup of the neighborhood was — whether it was crowded with tall or low-rise buildings or any tree cover. </p>\n<p id=\"ochSoP\">They used methods previously published in the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75018-4\">journal <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> to estimate how much those factors might warm or cool a neighborhood. That allowed them to calculate an urban heat island (UHI) index for each block group, a measure of how much hotter these areas are because of what the built environment looks like. </p>\n<p id=\"xwoeeZ\">The average per capita UHI index for all the locations studied was 8 degrees Fahrenheit, but some places can feel even hotter. You can explore <a href=\"https://climatecentral.observablehq.cloud/urban-heat-hot-spots/\">Climate Central’s interactive map</a> online to see how this plays out nationally and at the census block group level in each city.</p>\n<p id=\"nOZpx4\">In New York City, for instance, the per capita average UHI index reached 9.7 degrees — meaning the way many neighborhoods were built makes them feel close to 10 degrees hotter than they would without the same urban sprawl. NYC’s main weather observation <a href=\"https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/nws-heritage/-/100-years-of-weather-observations-at-belvedere-castle-in-central-park\">station</a> happens to be located in Central Park, where <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands\">tree cover and greenery can have a cooling effect</a> in comparison. In 2021, <em>The Verge</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature\">explored New York City with thermal cameras</a> and similarly found big differences in temperatures from neighborhood to neighborhood. </p>\n<div id=\"7VL3zg\">\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Taking NYC’s temperature with a thermal camera|102812\" data-volume-uuid=\"5d6810c5f\" data-volume-id=\"102812\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-480\" class=\"volume-video\" data-volume-player-choice=\"youtube\"></div>\n<div class=\"caption\"><strong>Why some city neighborhoods are hotter than others</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p id=\"tpqSFq\">The good news is that we know how to undo the urban heat island effect. Simple measures like painting rooftops and other surfaces lighter colors, planting trees, and greening roofs can all help neighborhoods cool down. That can make an even bigger difference in the future as climate change <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-waves#:~:text=This%20indicator%20examines%20trends%20over,the%20year%20and%20the%20last.\">makes heatwaves more frequent and intense</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"Gaf8sv\">“It’s very easy to go out and say, ‘Oh, this area’s hotter.’ But I think the logic behind this is very explicitly: why is it hotter?” Brady says. “I think then that leads to your solution.”</p>\n<p id=\"v01ovJ\"></p>"

We’re excited to see this momentum with Frontier buyers,” Astro Teller, captain of moonshots at Alphabet’s X, said in an emailed statement.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"ydIIZd\"><q>Filtering CO2 out of the air is trending among companies trying to hit sustainability targets</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"SqFrg2\">280 Earth builds modules containing absorbent materials — called sorbents — to filter CO2 out of the air. It’s similar to large industrial facilities called direct air capture (DAC) plants that other companies have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151905/mammoth-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture-climeworks\">started</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041405/capture-carbon-dioxide-desalination-petrochemicals-capture6-south-korea-pilot-project\">to</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23869817/amazon-climate-carbon-removal-purchase-occidental-petroleum\">build</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23651587/microsoft-climate-tech-startup-carboncapture-wyoming\">in</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23451865/occidental-oil-direct-air-capture-carbon-texas\">recent</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23584501/climate-tech-air-carbon-capture-concrete\">years</a>. But 280 Earth says it can run more efficiently, allowing it to work in tandem with data centers and draw some power from their waste heat. </p>\n<p id=\"nOI568\">Other DAC technologies work in big batches, waiting until the sorbent is fully saturated before heating the filter to high temperatures (upwards of 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit) to release and collect the CO2 that it trapped. 280 Earth says it saves energy by <em>not</em> working in batches. Instead, it continuously moves the sorbent between two chambers to avoid the energy loss that comes with reheating, cooling, and changing the pressure in a single chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"XP0i1E\">It’s sort of like the difference between a home oven and a professional pizza oven, says 280 Earth CEO John Pimentel. You lose heat and energy each time you turn a home oven on and off and open its door. The pizza oven, on the other hand, retains heat better and stays at the same temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"qsisGm\">Not only does 280 Earth’s technology capture CO2, but it also happens to pull in water vapor that it can extract to provide water for a customer. It can gather two to four tons of water for every ton of CO2 captured, according to Pimentel. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"6VLuyq\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:12322060\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"C5KBKK\">That’s all supposed to create a win-win situation for 280 Earth and a data center, or any other industrial facility that needs water and creates waste heat. One critique of DAC technology is how much energy it might need to heat up its filters. 280 Earth’s sorbents can do their job at low enough temperatures to utilize that industrial waste heat. Data centers, meanwhile, can burn through a lot of electricity <a href=\"https://grist.org/technology/surging-demand-data-guzzling-water-ai/\">and water</a> to run servers and keep them from overheating. 280 Earth can potentially help on that end by drawing in waste heat and producing water for cooling systems in return. </p>\n<p id=\"yWYAwm\">The biggest impact, though, would be to get rid of the carbon emissions causing climate change. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/2/24190874/google-ai-climate-change-carbon-emissions-rise\">Google’s carbon emissions have grown</a> by nearly 50 percent since 2019, for instance, thanks in large part to new and expanded data centers used to train AI. To that end, some environmental groups are worried that relying on new strategies to capture CO2 pollution after it’s already been released is risky. After all, these are new technologies that have yet to be proven at scale. They’re also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24127331/carbon-dioxide-removal-costs-rhodium-group-report\">prohibitively expensive</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24170729/direct-air-capture-carbon-dioxide-removal-climate-tech-climeworks-generation-3\">at the moment</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"1fG0rA\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Google’s carbon footprint balloons in its Gemini AI era\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/2/24190874/google-ai-climate-change-carbon-emissions-rise\"},{\"title\":\"Silicon Valley is enamored with a company that pumps poop underground \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24145535/silicon-valley-climate-tech-carbon-removal-vaulted-deep-frontier\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"8ssWRl\">280 Earth just finished building its pilot facility in Oregon in May, which will be used to capture 61,600 tons of CO2 by 2030 as part of the $40 million deal. The cost breaks down to more than $600 per ton of captured CO2. The company is still finalizing plans for where to sequester the CO2 after it’s captured, likely sending most of it by truck and rail to underground storage wells somewhere in the US. </p>\n<p id=\"reJfzV\">For context, Google was responsible for 14.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution in <a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2024-environmental-report.pdf\">2023</a> alone. That shows how small of a dent this initial carbon removal deal would make in its overall carbon footprint and how expensive it would be to pay to capture a larger chunk of its climate pollution. </p>\n<p id=\"64Ano9\">Scaling up carbon removal would bring costs down, Pimentel says. And he believes it buys time for companies as they transition to cleaner energy. “As much as we all want to believe that transition off of fossil fuels is going to happen quickly ... It’s going to take decades,” Pimentel says. “In the meantime, we’re continuing to pump more CO2 into the atmosphere, exacerbating the problems that we already have. So I’m a believer in the all of the above solution.”</p>\n<p id=\"uXM30p\"></p>"

Despite that goal, its carbon emissions actually <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/1/23287351/amazon-climate-change-carbon-emissions-worse-2021\">ballooned</a> soon after — climbing from around 51 million metric tons of CO2 in 2019 to more than 71 million metric tons in 2021. Now it seems that the company’s carbon footprint has shrunk a bit over the past couple years, decreasing 3 percent in 2023 to just under 69 million metric tons of CO2. </p>\n<p id=\"f6e3Wn\">To put it in context, Amazon’s carbon footprint last year was roughly <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results\">equivalent</a> to the annual CO2 emissions from 184 gas-fired power plants. And the company is still pumping out around 34 percent more carbon pollution than it did when it made its climate pledge in 2019. But it’s notable that Amazon’s emissions fell slightly in a year when other tech giants’ pollution shot up with the explosion of new AI tools. </p>\n<p id=\"SOLG1q\">Amazon says the drop is mostly thanks to cleaning up carbon pollution from its electricity use and indirect supply chains emissions, which fell 11 percent and 5 percent, respectively.<strong> </strong>It also announced that it reached its goal of <a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/renewable-energy-methodology.pdf\">matching</a> 100 percent of its electricity consumption with renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its 2030 deadline. </p>\n<p id=\"tc2Yom\">Breaking down what “matching” means gets a little tricky, but it’s important for understanding any company’s clean energy goals. Simply put, there isn’t enough renewable energy online yet to meet global climate goals, and siphoning off what’s available to meet a single giant company’s clean energy targets would be pretty unfeasible. Plus, when a company plugs into the grid, it doesn’t control whether the electricity it uses comes from a solar farm or fossil fuel power plant. Instead, companies typically pay to “match” their energy use with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/11/9/9696820/renewable-energy-certificates\">Renewable Energy Certificates</a> (RECs) meant to support renewable energy projects.</p>\n<p id=\"4vWuhF\">The quality of those RECs makes a difference. RECs can get so cheap that they’re no longer enough of a revenue source to incentivize <em>new</em> clean energy projects. As a result, many companies have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23160508/corporate-renewable-energy-misleading-rec-power-purchase-climate\">overestimated reductions in carbon emissions</a> through RECs, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01379-5\">research</a> published in 2022 found. And what’s really needed to stop climate change are new, additional sources of renewable energy. </p>\n<p id=\"TY6kmz\">To try to achieve this, other companies, including <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fachieving-100-percent-renewable-energy-with-247-monitoring-in-microsoft-sweden%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F7%2F10%2F24195707%2Famazons-carbon-emissions-fell-last-year\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/\">Google</a>, have set goals to match their electricity use with locally generated clean energy on an hourly basis (rather than on an annual basis). That’s supposed to support a future where there’s enough renewable energy to rely on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/247-hourly-matching-electricity\">24/7</a> on any grid a company plugs into. </p>\n<p id=\"S2CV1x\">Another alternative is to enter into a <a href=\"https://rmi.org/insight/virtual-power-purchase-agreement/\">Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)</a>, a long-term contract to support the development of a clean energy project and / or purchase electricity from it. Amazon is the biggest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, buying more solar and wind power through PPAs than Google and Microsoft combined, <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/amazon-is-top-green-energy-buyer-in-a-market-dominated-by-us/\">according to BloombergNEF</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"QLCFKp\">In comparison, Google and Microsoft saw their greenhouse gas emissions climb roughly 13 and 20 percent, respectively, last year as they infused AI into their products and services. Like Amazon, they’ve seen larger increases since setting climate goals several years ago. Microsoft’s carbon footprint was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157496/microsoft-ai-carbon-footprint-greenhouse-gas-emissions-grow-climate-pledge\">30 percent larger</a> in its 2023 fiscal year than it was in 2020, according to its latest sustainability report. Google’s carbon emissions, were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/2/24190874/google-ai-climate-change-carbon-emissions-rise\">48 percent higher in 2023</a> compared to 2019. Amazon is also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177664/amazon-llm-alexa-delayed-fortune\">bringing AI to Alexa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/29/24116056/amazon-ai-race-anthropic-olympus-claude\">other services</a> but is reportedly scrambling to catch up with other big players in the AI race.</p>\n<p id=\"HAzVyu\">Amazon also saw a 13 percent drop in emissions stemming from capital goods last year, as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/amazon-carbon-emissions-fell-in-2023-amid-post-pandemic-pullback\">noticed by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. That includes things like building construction and new servers, vehicles, and other equipment. The company’s capital expenditures dropped by around $10 billion in 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/amazon-carbon-emissions-fell-in-2023-amid-post-pandemic-pullback\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports. The company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23047095/amazon-q1-2022-earnings-why-stock-is-falling\">grew during the covid pandemic</a>, which sent its carbon emissions skyrocketing at the time. But after cutting down on warehouse and data center costs, its carbon emissions are also sliding.</p>\n<p id=\"0xzaly\"></p>"

The experimental tool, called <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/climate-answers/\">Climate Answers</a>, will use the outlet’s breadth of reporting to answer questions about climate change, the environment, sustainable energy, and more.</p>\n<p id=\"lV0MKU\">Some of the questions you can ask the chatbot include things like, “Should I get solar panels for my home?” or “Where in the US are sea levels rising the fastest?” Much like the other AI chatbots we’ve seen, it will then serve up a summary using the information it’s been trained on. In this case, Climate Answers uses the articles within <em>The Washington Post</em>’s climate section — as far back as the section’s launch in 2016 —  to answer questions. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VywsEIDaAshOsGof2rF0xZwZNfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25522431/wapo_climate_answers_response.png\">\n      <cite>Image: The Washington Post</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"xZ1CrI\">“We have a lot of innovative and original reporting,” Vineet Khosla, <em>The Washington Post</em>’s chief technology officer, said during an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “Somewhere in the years and years of the data-rich reporting we have done, there is an answer buried in one of the things we have written.”</p>\n<p id=\"rFD8gT\">Beneath the answer, you’ll find links to the articles that the chatbot used to produce its answer, along with the relevant snippet it pulled its information from. The tool is based on a large language model from OpenAI, but <em>The Washington Post</em> is also experimenting with AI models from Mistral and Meta’s Llama. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rp-Op2lVMngnsfFee89P5PSY7yg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25522436/wapo_climate_answers_source.png\">\n      <cite>Image: The Washington Post</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"gVvZzx\">When asked about the possibility of misinformation, Khosla said Climate Answers won’t produce a response for questions it doesn’t have an answer for. “Unlike other answer services, we really are baking this into verified journalism,” Khosla said. “If we don’t know the answer, I’d rather say ‘I don’t know’ than make up an answer.” However, we plan to try the tool when it launches today to get a sense of its guardrails.</p>\n<p id=\"lR38tu\"><em>The Washington Post</em> isn’t the only news outlet that’s relying on its archive of information to power an AI chatbot. In March, the<em> Financial Times</em> started testing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/23/24106296/ask-ft-generative-ai-chatbot-answers-tool\">Ask FT, a chatbot that subscribers</a> can use to get answers about topics related to the outlet’s reporting. Meanwhile, other publishers, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162782/openai-licensing-deal-wall-street-journal-news-corp\">News Corp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999861/openai-axel-springer-chatgpt-ai-content-insider-politico\">Axel Springer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151171/openai-dotdash-meredith-people-instyle-licensing\">Dotdash Meredith</a>, and <em>The Verge</em>’s<em> </em>parent company, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167072/openai-content-copyright-vox-media-the-atlantic\">Vox Media</a>, have jumped into licensing partnerships with OpenAI.</p>\n<p id=\"WKtSxc\"><em>The Washington Post</em> has been gradually <a href=\"https://futurism.com/washington-post-pivot-ai\">building on its use of AI</a>; according to Khosla, the outlet has also rolled out AI-powered summaries for some of its articles. Even though <em>The Washington Post</em>’s new chatbot is only able to field climate-related questions for now, Khosla didn’t rule out the possibility of expanding it across other topics the outlet covers. “We absolutely expect this experiment to extend and scale to everything <em>The Washington Post</em> does,” Khosla said.</p>"

But its total greenhouse gas emissions have actually grown by 48 percent since 2019. Last year alone, it produced 14.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution — a 13 percent year-over-year increase from the year before and roughly equivalent to the amount of CO2 that <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results\">38 gas-fired power plants</a> might release annually.</p>\n<p id=\"s4thoh\">The jump in planet-heating pollution primarily comes from data center energy use and supply chain emissions, according to Google’s environmental report. Data centers are notoriously energy-hungry — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption\">those used to train AI even more so</a>. Electricity consumption, mostly from data centers, added nearly a million metric tons of pollution to the company’s carbon footprint in 2023 and represents the biggest source of Google’s additional emissions last year. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"hah6xF\"><q>“As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"hKy4nh\">Google is in its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990466/google-gemini-llm-ai-model\">Gemini era</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview\">redesigning Search with generative AI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24158374/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-search-gemini-future-of-the-internet-web-openai-decoder-interview\">injecting AI into its other products</a> like so many other tech giants are racing to do these days. The company points to the potential climate costs those new tools could have in its environmental report. </p>\n<p id=\"SNXPvj\">“As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,” the report says. Google’s data center electricity consumption alone grew by 17 percent in 2023, a “trend” it expects to continue in the future, according to the report. Already, Google estimates that its data centers accounted for up to 10 percent of global data center electricity consumption in 2023. </p>\n<p id=\"Y0d1uv\">To try to minimize its environmental impact, Google says it’s trying to make its AI models, hardware, and data centers more energy-efficient. The company also has a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/\">goal</a> of running on carbon pollution-free energy around the clock on each power grid it plugs into by 2030. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"YIHCJK\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Microsoft’s AI obsession is jeopardizing its climate ambitions \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157496/microsoft-ai-carbon-footprint-greenhouse-gas-emissions-grow-climate-pledge\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"7ocniL\">Today, the world’s data centers use around 1 percent of the world’s electricity, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks\">according to the International Energy Agency</a> (IEA). But with the AI industry booming, the IEA recently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049047/data-center-ai-crypto-bitcoin-mining-electricity-report-iea\">estimated</a> that it could consume <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-2024\">10 times as much electricity in 2026</a> as it did last year. In the US, the country with the most data centers, that’s raised fears about the steep rise in electricity demand from AI <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/\">overwhelming power grids</a> and potentially <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/ai-needs-so-much-power-that-old-coal-plants-are-sticking-around\">keeping coal and gas plants around for longer</a> than they would have otherwise.  </p>\n<p id=\"lxhOWh\">Google’s not alone when it comes to AI placing corporate climate aims further out of reach.

The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is expected to post its new heat protections on the federal register today, Biden administration officials said on a press call yesterday. </p>\n<p id=\"DKukaw\">The rules are supposed to prevent heat-related illnesses and deaths on the job. Heat already <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/\">kills far more people in the US</a> than hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, or any other weather-related disaster. Global warming is only <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-waves\">making the problem worse</a>, leading to longer, more frequent, and more intense heatwaves. The proposed rules are meant to enable workplace protections to catch up with that reality. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"PS3Bjw\"><q>Heat already kills far more people in the US than hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, or any other weather-related disaster</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"9T2v2W\">Under the new rules, employers would need to craft plans to prevent heat injury and illness. That includes designating a heat safety coordinator and having procedures in place to respond to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/extreme-heat/signs-symptoms/index.html\">symptoms</a> of heat illness like muscle cramps, nausea, and fainting. </p>\n<p id=\"ebwhLC\">They’d also have to monitor workplaces for potentially dangerous conditions. A heat index of 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which takes into account both heat and humidity, would trigger a set of requirements to keep workers safe. Employees working in that heat would need access to drinking water and a break area where they can cool down, for instance. A heat index of 90F or higher would trigger more requirements, including paid 15-minute breaks every couple of hours on the job. Rest breaks can help people acclimatize to the heat, according to Biden administration officials on the call. </p>\n<p id=\"w9Lsoi\">The rule is expected to cover some 35 million workers who are routinely exposed to heat risk — including people who work in construction, agriculture, and other jobs outdoors. It doesn’t cover teleworkers or folks who work indoors with air conditioning that consistently keeps temperatures below the heat index thresholds laid out in the rules. Nor does it include state and local public employees who are <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3021.pdf\">not covered by OSHA</a> or certain emergency responders.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"qCYlZJ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Athletes sound warning about extreme heat at Summer Olympics \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181004/summer-paris-olympics-heatwave-athletes-report\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"2gPAzv\">The proposal is already a few years in the making — the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683791/us-workers-extreme-heat-stress-workplace-protections-federal-labor-standard-osha\">announced that it would start the rulemaking process</a> back in September 2021. “While we have all seen the graphic and heart-wrenching images of super-storms, wildfires, and floods in recent weeks, another climate disaster is lurking just below the radar: extreme heat,” President Joe Biden said in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/20/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-mobilizing-the-administration-to-address-extreme-heat/\">statement</a> at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"wFsDCK\">You could use the same words to describe more recent disasters, including Hurricane Beryl <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-beryl-category-5-storm-jamaica-07-02-24/index.html\">tearing through the Caribbean</a> this week and a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-01/california-wildfires-basin-fire-update\">heatwave exacerbating raging blazes in California</a>.

That support has fallen to 64 and 56 percent, respectively, for solar and wind farms this year. More than 80 percent of Republicans surveyed, compared to 35 percent of Democrats, oppose the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106638/biden-epa-vehicle-emissions-final-standards-electric-hybrid\">Environmental Protection Agency’s new standards for greenhouse gas emissions</a> from tailpipes expected to make more than half of car sales EVs by 2032.</p>\n<p id=\"McLHve\">Those shifts in opinion coincide with the Biden administration’s push to incentivize new renewable energy projects since he was elected in 2020.

Most of that money supports EV and battery manufacturing. A separate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/16/climate/clean-energy-investment-republicans/index.html\">analysis by CNN</a> similarly found that nearly 78 percent of IRA investments go to congressional Republican districts.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"tdlixc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Congress votes to advance nuclear&amp;nbsp;energy&amp;nbsp;development in the US \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181808/congress-pass-nuclear-energy-bill-biden-signature\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"Jv9Uny\">We’ll have to wait and see if that infusion of cash happens to shift Republicans’ views on renewables. But the tides could also turn again with younger Republicans, who are far more optimistic about solar and wind energy than their older counterparts. Only 22 percent of Republicans aged 65 or older in the survey said that expanding renewable energy production should be a priority. In contrast, 67 percent of Republicans between the ages of 18 and 29 said renewable energy ought to be the priority over coal, oil, and gas production. In general, young adults are more likely to think climate change will cause more harm in the US in their lifetime, according to another Pew <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/10/25/how-americans-view-future-harms-from-climate-change-in-their-community-and-around-the-u-s/\">survey</a> published in October. </p>\n<p id=\"Q9yWMd\"></p>"

Even when Capitol Hill is <em>not </em>mired in deep dysfunction, the speed at which Congress and the courts operate no longer seems suitable for modern life. Both industry and ordinary people look to the administrative state, rather than legislators, for an immediate answer to their problems. And since 1984, the administrative state largely ran on one Supreme Court precedent: <em>Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). </em></p>\n<p id=\"SOcOWQ\">That decision has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24180118/supreme-court-chevron-deference-decision-opinion\">now been overturned</a>. Admin law is not always interesting, but the simple fact is when it comes to the day-to-day, agencies are the most impactful part of the federal government. No single policy writer at <em>The Verge</em> can fully articulate the impact of Friday’s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24781892-loper-bright-enterprises-v-raimondo\">Supreme Court decision</a> and how profound its effects will be. The administrative state touches everything around us: net neutrality, climate change, clean air and water, and what scant consumer protections we have. </p>\n<p id=\"CQfNER\">The true scope of this ruling will not be immediately felt, and what replaces Chevron deference is still unclear. The regulatory state has been under steady attack from an increasingly conservative judiciary for a long time. Some of the agencies we follow most closely were kneecapped even before this decision — one expert we talked to said that <em>Chevron</em> had been a “dead letter for quite some time.”</p>\n<p id=\"FgRcFx\">Still, this is a formal turning point. The biggest policy stories at <em>The Verge</em> have centered around federal agencies. And for a long time, the kind of regulation that actually kept up with the pace of technology was mostly coming out of agencies. It is in the years to come that we will wonder, “Why isn’t anyone doing anything?” or “How can a court just unilaterally do that?” about issues that range from trivial to life-threatening. </p>\n<p id=\"wwLqrj\">We’ll look back on this moment as a pivotal part of how we got there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ZKLOjW\">What is Chevron deference?</h2>\n<p id=\"UzZMwB\">It is a longstanding doctrine in which courts defer to federal agencies when there are disputes over how to interpret ambiguous language in legislation passed by Congress. The underlying reasoning is that subject matter experts within the agency are probably able to make more informed decisions than a judge recently assigned to the case. Chevron deference is strong deference — and the low bar for deferring to agencies means that regulations tend not to get tied up in court. </p>\n<p id=\"CGdMKB\">“The key point of <em>Chevron</em> was that laws like these are policy decisions, and those policy decisions should be made by the political branches responsive to the voters, Congress and the president, not by unaccountable judges with no constituents,” David Doniger, an attorney and senior advisor to the NRDC Action Fund, said in a press briefing earlier this month. Doniger happened to litigate and lose the case that gave Chevron deference its name. </p>\n<p id=\"dO2AOS\">While the practice had been in place for decades before, it came to be known as Chevron deference after a 1984 case: <em>Chevron v. NRDC</em>. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Chevron, allowing the Ronald Reagan administration’s industry-friendly Environmental Protection Agency to stick with a lax interpretation of the Clean Air Act.</p>\n<p id=\"bTrIeb\">Over the years, Chevron deference has enabled federal agencies to tackle all sorts of issues that legislators have yet to cover — from addressing greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change to regulating broadband access. As <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/01/chevron-supreme-court-case/677220/\">the conservative legal movement</a> to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/175899/supreme-court-watch-chevron-deference\">disempower the administrative state grew</a>, Chevron deference became — in certain circles — shorthand for government overreach.</p>\n<p id=\"s4QsnM\">Before its decision to overturn <em>Chevron</em>, the Supreme Court had already dealt a blow to federal agencies’ regulatory authority by strengthening the <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12077#:~:text=Under%20the%20Court's%20formulation%20of,require%20it%20to%20do%20so.\">“major questions” doctrine</a> in its 2022 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23184791/supreme-court-west-virginia-epa-decision-climate-change-power-plants-what-happens-next\">decision in <em>West Virginia v. EPA</em></a>. According to the major questions doctrine, a federal agency shouldn’t have the leeway to craft regulation on an issue of major national significance if Congress hasn’t explicitly allowed it to do so in legislation. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"OHaBFd\"><q>When two cases calling for an end to Chevron deference worked their way up to SCOTUS, the writing was on the wall</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"q1VTGN\">The same bloc of six conservative justices that formed the majority in <em>West Virginia v. EPA </em>also overturned the longstanding precedent of <em>Roe v. Wade — </em>an even older case than <em>Chevron —</em> in the same month. When two cases calling for an end to Chevron deference worked their way up to the Supreme Court this year, the writing was on the wall — and once again, those same six justices overturned <em>Chevron</em>. </p>\n<p id=\"3XYKwg\"><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em> and <em>Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce</em> were factually about an agency rule on fishing boats, but everyone more or less knew that <em>Chevron</em> was on the line. The cases garnered support from a broad swath of industry interests, including <a href=\"https://www.gunowners.org/goa-and-gof-file-amicus-brief-with-scotus-in-chevron-case/\">Gun Owners of America</a> and <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-451/272702/20230724125229569_Printer%20Ready%20Brief%20Jul%2020_v3.pdf\">e-cigarette companies</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"YvluW0\"><a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/175899/supreme-court-watch-chevron-deference\">Legal commentator Matt Ford wrote</a> earlier this year that this interplay between the judiciary and industry was hardly an open secret, quoting Don McGahn — who would eventually become Trump’s White House counsel — at CPAC 2018 saying outright that “the judicial selection and the deregulatory effort are really the flip side of the same coin.”    </p>\n<p id=\"nNLZBv\">It’s not yet certain what has replaced <em>Chevron</em>, though some of the wording in the decision suggests we may fall back on a doctrine known as Skidmore deference — a weaker deference, meaning that judges have more power to block agency rules. “The idea that <em>Skidmore</em> is going to be a backup once you get rid of <em>Chevron</em>, that <em>Skidmore</em> means anything other than nothing, <em>Skidmore</em> has always meant nothing,” Justice Elena Kagan said during <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2023/22-451_o7jp.pdf\">oral arguments in January</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Y6WaiF\">The new threat to net neutrality</h2>\n<p id=\"hRyex1\">The Federal Communications Commission has famously interpreted Title II of the Communications Act to regulate internet service providers as common carriers in a policy known as net neutrality. Reclassifying ISPs as telecommunications services, rather than information services, would let the FCC impose more regulations on the industry, including mandating that they can’t unfairly block or throttle internet traffic. The idea is to keep ISPs from controlling what information users do or don’t see on the internet. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24119889/net-neutrality-fcc-vote-rules-restore\">In its latest move to restore the rules</a>, the FCC said reclassifying ISPs as common carriers would also give the agency more oversight over internet outages and help it better secure internet infrastructure.</p>\n<p id=\"4usQdx\">That interpretation could come under threat, even as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140157/fcc-vote-restore-net-neutrality-rosenworcel-biden\">the FCC just recently voted to reinstate net neutrality</a> after it was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893342/fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-dc-appeals-court-ruling-state-law-preemption\">repealed during the Trump administration</a>. “Overruling <em>Chevron</em> has the potential to change the tenor of the impending judicial challenge to the new net neutrality rules dramatically,” University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School professor <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1418&amp;context=faculty_articles\">Christopher Yoo wrote</a> in an article published prior to the Supreme Court ruling. That’s in part because prior judicial review relevant to net neutrality has taken Chevron deference into consideration. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"RHjFwA\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The fight for net neutrality is forever\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23727238/net-neutrality-history-fcc-legislation\"},{\"title\":\"The FCC wants to make it easier to unlock cellphones\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187651/fcc-cell-phone-unlock-rules-60-days\"},{\"title\":\"FCC clamps down on confusing ‘hidden fees’ in your cable TV bill \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101802/cable-tv-bill-fee-satellite-tv-providers-subscription-price-fcc\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"KQ4oDP\">For example, even when the FCC previously chose to classify ISPs in a way that would lead to lighter-touch regulation, the Supreme Court ruled in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/04-277\"><em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services</em></a><em> </em>that Chevron deference should be applied to the FCC’s interpretation of the Communications Act. “<em>Brand X’</em>s conclusion that the statute at issue is ambiguous made it highly likely that reviewing courts applying <em>Chevron</em> would uphold the net neutrality rules under review regardless of whether they were regulatory or deregulatory,” Yoo wrote.</p>\n<p id=\"HTyi3G\">The downfall of Chevron deference could completely change the ways courts review net neutrality, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Matt Schettenhelm. “The FCC’s 2024 effort to reinstitute federal broadband regulation is the latest chapter in a long-running regulatory saga, yet we think the demise of deference will change its course in a fundamental way,” he wrote in a recent report. “This time, we don’t expect the FCC to prevail in court as it did in 2016.” Schettenhelm estimated an 80 percent chance of the FCC’s newest net neutrality order being blocked or overturned in the absence of Chevron deference.</p>\n<p id=\"RCfae9\">There’s still some hope at the appeals level that the FCC could successfully argue that its interpretation of its authority to regulate broadband is the best way to read the law. But Schettenhelm told <em>The Verge</em> it will be a “tough sell” to a conservative and business-friendly Supreme Court, which could make the final call on net neutrality.</p>\n<p id=\"5YFUCI\">After the opinion came out, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think tank that receives funding from ISPs including AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon, cheered the decision and said it makes it “even less likely that the FCC’s recent regulatory overreaches on Digital Discrimination and Title II for the Internet will survive judicial review.” ITIF said the FCC’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23962881/fcc-anti-digital-discrimination-pass\">November 2023 digital discrimination order</a> — which allows the agency to fine telecom companies when they fail to provide equal connectivity to different groups without a good reason — could also be in danger. “Now, the Commission will no longer have the refuge of statutory ambiguity to shield this overreach from judicial scrutiny,” ITIF director of broadband and spectrum policy Joe Kane said in a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"FCsklC\">— <em>Lauren Feiner</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"0xbFz8\">What will happen to the environment and efforts to fight climate change</h2>\n<p id=\"7ewn1h\">“It’s no coincidence that <em>Chevron</em> itself was an environmental case … especially for an agency like the Environmental Protection Agency that makes these highly technical, highly scientifically based decisions under very, very complicated statutes. <em>Chevron</em> was very important,” Lisa Heinzerling, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, said in a call with <em>The Verge</em> prior to today’s opinion. </p>\n<p id=\"SVAmE3\">Overruling <em>Chevron</em> is essentially <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/175899/supreme-court-watch-chevron-deference\">a big power grab</a>, experts tell <em>The Verge. </em>It pushes the agency’s technical experts to the side when it comes to crafting environmental protections. In recent years, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court had already whittled down the agency’s regulatory authority — notably, by strengthening the major questions doctrine that Heinzerling describes as “the anti-Chevron.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"tsVbrt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The EPA’s new power plant pollution rule has a big, gassy hole in it\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24139494/power-plant-pollution-epa-final-rule-climate\"},{\"title\":\"Carbon capture will probably make electricity more expensive\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23663202/carbon-capture-electricity-gas-coal-power-plants-climate-change\"},{\"title\":\"The Supreme Court just took away an EPA tool to fight&amp;nbsp;climate change \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23184791/supreme-court-west-virginia-epa-decision-climate-change-power-plants-what-happens-next\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"eZSQjq\">As a result, the EPA has already pivoted away from relying on Chevron deference, according to NRDC Action Fund’s Doniger. A <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel\">rule</a> the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24139494/power-plant-pollution-epa-final-rule-climate\">EPA finalized in April</a> for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants is a prime example. The Supreme Court decision in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23184791/supreme-court-west-virginia-epa-decision-climate-change-power-plants-what-happens-next\"><em>West Virginia v. EPA</em></a> not only strengthened the major questions doctrine, it also said that the EPA’s rules shouldn’t determine whether utilities use fossil fuels or renewable energy. That effectively pushed the EPA to turn to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23663202/carbon-capture-electricity-gas-coal-power-plants-climate-change\">controversial technologies that capture carbon dioxide</a> from power plants in its policy to cut greenhouse gas emissions. </p>\n<p id=\"EAqdGU\">The EPA wrote the rule in a way that anticipated the fall of <em>Chevron</em> so that it can withstand legal challenges, Doniger said in a call with <em>The Verge</em>. But even with the EPA’s preemptively defensive crouch, its power plant rule “is incredibly legally vulnerable” to a rollback of Chevron deference, former Trump administration EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/what-chevrons-end-could-mean-for-epa-climate-regulations/\">said</a> in a <a href=\"https://politico-energy.simplecast.com/episodes/former-epa-chief-wheeler-on-what-a-second-trump-administration-looks-like-sUCHQfT9\">May episode</a> of the<em> Politico Energy</em> podcast. </p>\n<p id=\"5bJR86\">“The overall pattern here is clear — it’s not just in this decision — the court majority is on a rampage designed to make it harder for the government to protect us,” Doniger said. </p>\n<p id=\"tAv9DM\"><em>— Justine Calma</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"UYBkjF\">What happens to the push to regulate Big Tech</h2>\n<p id=\"rofHnT\">Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan has made no secret of her ambitions to use the agency’s authority to take bold action to restore competition to digital markets and protect consumers. But with <em>Chevron</em> being overturned amid a broader movement undermining agency authority without clear direction from Congress, Schettenhelm said, “it’s about the worst possible time for the FTC to be claiming novel rulemaking power to address unfair competition issues in a way that it never has before.”</p>\n<p id=\"VHmZ6K\">Khan’s methods have drawn intense criticism from the business community, most recently with the agency’s labor-friendly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138559/ftc-noncompete-agreement-ban\">rulemaking banning noncompete agreements</a> in employment contracts. That action relies on the FTC’s interpretation of its authority to allow it to take action in this area — the kind of thing that brings up questions about agency deference. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"12fNhd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Federal Trade Commission expands antitrust powers in Chair Lina Khan’s first open proceeding\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559131/ftc-open-meeting-antitrust-chair-lina-khan-sherman-act-powers\"},{\"title\":\"The FTC is pushing for changes to how Big Tech handles data \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/11/23301327/ftc-anpr-data-privacy-rule-regulation-surveillance-lina-khan\"},{\"title\":\"The FTC wants to put a ban on fake reviews \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779880/ftc-fake-reviews-ban-ai\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"tdxos2\">But the FTC has already had to contend with trends cutting away at agency deference for quite some time. For example, the noncompete rulemaking is already facing scrutiny under the <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12077\">major questions doctrine</a>, which is cited in the US Chamber of Commerce’s challenge. It’s a principle that’s shown up in Supreme Court cases that basically says Congress must grant clear authority for questions of great political or economic significance. The chamber <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/assets/documents/Complaint-Chamber-v.-FTC-E.D.-Tex.pdf\">argues in its lawsuit</a> to block the FTC noncompete rule that the Supreme Court has invoked the major questions Doctrine “to reject similar attempts by administrative agencies to take unprecedented actions with vast economic and political significance based on nothing more than ambiguous and ancillary statutory text—particularly where the agency has never before pointed to that text as a font of regulatory power.”</p>\n<p id=\"oQv1KN\">“The Supreme Court has taken most of the wind out of the sails of <em>Chevron</em> with the major questions doctrine, in the sense that when an agency enters into a regulatory area that it hasn’t been in before, the Supreme Court has created a strong presumption the agency does not have the authority to regulate,” said Jack Beermann, an administrative law expert and professor at Boston University School of Law. “And so <em>Chevron</em> doesn’t enter into the picture in cases like that.”</p>\n<p id=\"3vQ2JM\">David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law who led the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection from 2009 to 2012, said that “courts started to back off of <em>Chevron</em>” during the Obama administration, decreasing the utility of citing it as a defense. “As a result, lawyers like myself who were representing agencies would not rely on <em>Chevron</em>, and generally wouldn’t cite it because it wasn’t going to change the balance of the case. But it may signal that you need this deference in order to prevail.” Because of that, the overruling of <em>Chevron</em> could have a more muted impact on an agency like the FTC because “by and large, <em>Chevron</em> has been a dead letter for quite some time,” Vladeck said.</p>\n<p id=\"myCEHk\">Still, there are some areas where it could come into play or exacerbate existing trends. For example, Khan has sought to enforce Section 5 of the FTC Act, governing “unfair methods of competition,” more expansively than in the past. It’s often cited in antitrust cases alongside other federal statutes like the Sherman Act. But in 2022, the FTC <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/P221202Section5PolicyStatement.pdf\">released a policy statement</a> saying it could bring enforcement matters under Section 5 on a standalone basis and that authority under the statute goes beyond that of the other federal antitrust laws. Under <em>Chevron</em>, “the agency could rely on deference to their interpretation in order to say what constitutes an unfair method of competition,” said Ryan Quillian, a partner at Covington who served as deputy director of the FTC’s Technology Enforcement Division from 2020 to 2022. But with Friday’s decision, Quillian said, that effort “could be in jeopardy.”</p>\n<p id=\"jnHoEv\"><em>— Lauren Feiner</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"AbqOHq\">Tech workers on visas and immigration law </h2>\n<p id=\"VdrQ8G\">With regards to immigration, Chevron deference has given the Department of Homeland Security and its component agencies broad latitude. For example, under <em>Chevron</em>, decisions made by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — the federal agency that, among other things, issues non-immigrant, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21306188/guest-worker-ban-trump-h1b-visa-immigration-stamp-entry\">work-based visas like H-1Bs</a> — were more difficult to challenge because of the requirement that courts defer to federal agencies. Tech companies rely heavily on H-1B workers. Nine of the 10 companies that filed the most H-1B petitions during the 2022 fiscal year —including Amazon, Google, and Meta — were in the tech sector, according to federal data <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/tech-and-outsourcing-companies-continue-to-exploit-the-h-1b-visa-program-at-a-time-of-mass-layoffs-the-top-30-h-1b-employers-hired-34000-new-h-1b-workers-in-2022-and-laid-off-at-least-85000-workers/\">analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"osI96F\">“In the past, employers have had a hard time overturning narrow interpretations of H-1B issues because of Chevron deference,” Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, told <em>The Verge</em>. “Now, however, people who feel that the agency is too stingy in its interpretation of various visa categories may be more likely to seek court review.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"RyNQ6q\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Homeland: a special series from The Verge\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/c/23055922/homeland-security-series\"},{\"title\":\"The children of tech’s guest&amp;nbsp;workers are pushing for immigration relief\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22585007/h1b-dependent-visa-age-out-documented-dreamers-immigration-reform\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"89qeJK\">The desire to seek court review, however, will likely depend on an applicant’s location. Jonathan Wasden, a former government attorney whose firm, Wasden Banias, specializes in visa cases, said the overturning of <em>Chevron</em> will likely create a patchwork system. “I was hoping for them to create a framework, but right now it’s really in the eye of the particular judge that’s reviewing your case — which is great if you’re a litigant and an agency is acting silly, but for the government, it’s going to be a big problem,” Wasden told <em>The Verge</em>. “You’re looking at 96 federal courts with all different views of how the statute is supposed to work.”</p>\n<p id=\"LyqYUt\">Going forward, instead of relying on a single framework across the country, USCIS will likely pay more attention to where an applicant is located to determine how statutes will apply to them. “For an agency that already is challenged, it’s going to be tough, because they’re just not that nimble,” Wasden said. </p>\n<p id=\"0Gk1oM\">In other words, the amount of recourse available to a person whose H-1B petition is denied by USCIS will depend largely on their location. Wasden predicts that the biggest challenge for the government will be in “as applied” cases, or those that argue that the <em>application</em> of a particular statute or policy — and not the statute or policy itself — is unconstitutional. “There’s going to be a lot of individual litigants with compelling facts across the country on the exact same issue, and we’re going to see a variety of ways to resolve and interpret the law in those cases,” Wasden said. </p>\n<p id=\"sN1Iq7\">The effects of this patchwork system will not be felt immediately, nor will they be felt evenly. “A lot needs to be worked out,” said Yale-Loehr, “and it will be confusing and complicated for several years.“</p>\n<p id=\"5Zf33C\"><em>— Gaby Del Valle</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"bqY0YE\">Labor and workers’ rights</h2>\n<p id=\"5NbkqH\">The overturning of <em>Chevron </em>may make it easier to challenge policies implemented by labor agencies going forward, including efforts to enact workplace safety regulations. The Biden administration has implemented a number of regulations related to workplace safety and worker treatment. This year alone, the Department of Labor <a href=\"https://blog.dol.gov/2024/04/23/what-the-new-overtime-rule-means-for-workers\">extended overtime pay</a> to workers making below $58,656, announced a regulation allowing third parties on worksite inspections, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued new guidance on workplace harassment for the first time since 1999. The regulation raising the salary threshold for overtime pay, slated to go into effect on July 1st, faces <a href=\"https://www.foley.com/insights/publications/2024/06/dol-rule-increasing-exempt-employee-salary-threshold-challenges/\">multiple legal challenges</a> from industry groups.</p>\n<p id=\"6iPPrG\">In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Charlotte Garden, a professor of labor law at the University of Minnesota, said the decision to overturn <em>Chevron</em> will likely be “disruptive for workers’ rights.”</p>\n<p id=\"yJ4OYg\">“The DOL’s long-standing approach to whether an employee is ‘exempt’ from overtime under the ‘white-collar’ exemption involves looking at both the amount of the employee’s salary, and their duties — so employees are entitled to overtime pay unless they earn more than the salary threshold and perform qualifying duties,” Garden said. Business groups have argued that the DOL “isn’t allowed to set a salary threshold <em>at all</em>” — an argument Garden said is more likely to win now that <em>Chevron</em> is overturned. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"HsgjA9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Former OpenAI employees say whistleblower protection on AI safety is not enough\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171283/openai-safety-open-letter-whistleblower-agi\"},{\"title\":\"Amazon dodged workplace safety regulators for years, investigation shows\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983452/amazon-workplace-safety-report-injuries-osha-investigation\"},{\"title\":\"Biden’s Labor Department reverses Trump-era gig worker rule \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420896/biden-labor-department-reverse-gig-worker-rule-trump\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"Wvajx1\">“Under <em>Chevron</em>, if a judge thought the [Fair Labor Standards Act] was ambiguous, it would then defer to the DOL’s reasonable interpretation of that statute,” Garden said. “But now, judges are free to decide what they think the best reading is.” As is the case with immigration, different judges will reach different decisions about how to interpret regulations, which could lead to different regulatory schemes across the country.</p>\n<p id=\"VXo7lr\">Under Biden, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/climate/extreme-heat-biden-workplace.html\">has been working on heat stress regulations</a> intended to protect workers from increasingly high temperatures on the job — a proposal that has already faced pushback.</p>\n<p id=\"WZoFw2\">“It’s much harder for an agency to take big swings when it’s regulatory authority when it’s not going to get a layup when it goes into defendant,” Alexander MacDonald, a shareholder at Littler’s Workplace Policy Institute, told <em>The Verge</em>. </p>\n<p id=\"7UjJr4\">Michael Rubin, a partner with the public interest firm Altshuler Berzon, said the success of these challenges remains to be seen. “They still have to go through the same procedures for challenging it: a challenge goes to court, and it simply means that the courts will take a de novo — fresh look — at the statute,” said Rubin, whose firm has <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/economy/2023/03/court-ruling-gig-driver-union/\">represented gig worker drivers</a> and Apple employees who recently <a href=\"https://www.treasuryandrisk.com/2024/06/24/you-start-lower-you-stay-lower-apple-hit-with-class-action-for-gender-bias/?slreturn=20240628124922\">filed a gender discrimination lawsuit</a> against the company. More consequential, Rubin adds, is the fact that the Supreme Court is divided on how to construe statutes and constitutional provisions. “There’s likely to be far more litigation, without the benefit of Chevron deference, resulting in greater uncertainties, greater delays, and more inefficient practices throughout the country,” Rubin said. “It’s going to put an enormous burden on Congress and the courts, as well as the agencies, and it will certainly take months — if not years — to determine the actual impact.”</p>\n<p id=\"HA8Lm7\"><em>— Gaby Del Valle</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"GdA1qD\">The right to repair, copyright, patent law, and the Apple Watch ban </h2>\n<p id=\"GxifcP\">Intellectual property issues will probably see the least impact and almost certainly the lowest body count, but the fact that Chevron deference is applicable to any of these issues at all may be illustrative of the sheer scope of the administrative state. </p>\n<p id=\"c6Y5pO\">In 2015, an appeals court applied <em>Chevron</em> to the <a href=\"https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/12-1170.opinion.8-6-2015.1.pdf\">US International Trade Commission</a>. The ITC does many things, but you likely last heard about it in 2023 when it ruled that the Apple Watch <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute\">infringed on patents for pulse oximetry</a>, resulting in a temporary ban for imports of the Apple Watch. “I do think the demise of <em>Chevron</em> will affect patent law, though I agree most folks will have bigger fish to fry,” Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, wrote in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. “The ITC would presumably not be entitled to deference in its interpretation of patent law.”</p>\n<p id=\"3H1mh2\">In 2017, an appeals court — controversially — applied <em>Chevron</em> to the <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/aqua-prods-inc-v-matal-1\">Patent and Trademark Office’s</a> interpretation of patent law. “The PTO makes few substantive rules,” Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, wrote in an email. The less agency rulemaking, the less impact overturning <em>Chevron</em> will have. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"phcDlp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Right to repair: all the latest news and updates \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23738770/right-to-repair-updates-laws\"},{\"title\":\"Apple Watch ban: everything you need to know \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"Lnt8io\">But there is one notable part of intellectual property law where agency rulemaking matters quite a lot and happens in bulk: every three years, the Copyright Office issues exemptions for DMCA Section 1201. These cover <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24101023/ftc-doj-comment-dmca-ifixit-ice-cream-machines\">the right to repair</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747310/us-copyright-office-dmca-section-1201-exemption-rulemaking-report\">unlocking cellphones</a>, ripping DVDs for archival or educational purposes, taking apart electronic voting machines to test for security issues, and more. The Copyright Office falls under the legislative branch, rather than the executive, where admin law traditionally applies. But earlier in June, <a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/17294BB992D313C285258B35004FAEBA/$file/23-5067-2058361.pdf\">an appeals court ruled these DMCA rulemakings were subject to the Administrative Procedure Act</a>, the 1946 statute from which <em>Chevron</em>, <em>Loper Bright</em>, and the entire administrative state stems. These DMCA rulemakings are already contentious, even when enclosed in the usually boring <a href=\"https://www.justia.com/administrative-law/rulemaking-writing-agency-regulations/notice-and-comment/\">notice-and-comment process</a> — but the combination of this ruling and the death of <em>Chevron</em> may have the recurring triennial conflict sprawling into the courts as well. </p>\n<p id=\"aAWNhI\">To be clear, none of these are <em>necessarily</em> bad outcomes — and as Lemley notes, most people “have bigger fish to fry.” No one is going to think, <em>Well, on the one hand climate change will kill us all, but on the other hand, I have my Apple Watch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"4768Fr\">Beyond that, the disempowering of federal agencies means the empowerment of another entity — and in this case, it is the increasingly conservative judiciary. Article III courts do not always make the best decisions, even when it comes to relatively apolitical issues like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17169064/federal-circuit-oracle-v-google-third-trial-java-android\">software copyright</a>. This shift in the balance of power will touch on issues both big and small, dire and inane in the years to come.  </p>\n<p class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"S3MjSX\"><em>— Sarah Jeong</em></p>\n<p id=\"oZMJWU\"></p>"

Six Republican-appointed justices voted to overturn the doctrine, called Chevron deference, a decision that could affect everything from pollution limits to consumer protections in the US. </p>\n<p id=\"TWQ4Ac\">Chevron deference allows courts to defer to federal agencies when there are disputes over how to interpret ambiguous language in legislation passed by Congress. That’s supposed to lead to more informed decisions by leaning on expertise within those agencies. By overturning the Chevron doctrine, the conservative-dominated SCOTUS decided that judges ought to make the call instead of agency experts. </p>\n<p id=\"L02VJd\">“Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron’s presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do,” Chief Justice John Roberts writes in his opinion. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"4g4RFq\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How SCOTUS could gut environmental protections in 2024\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24080192/supreme-court-pollution-environment-cases-2024-epa\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"11AiJB\">The decision effectively strips federal agencies of a tool they’ve been able to use to take action on pressing issues while Congress tries to catch up with new laws. Chevron deference has come up, for instance, in <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/what-chevrons-end-could-mean-for-epa-climate-regulations/#:~:text=The%20so%2Dcalled%20Chevron%20doctrine,health%20care%20and%20carbon%20emissions.\">efforts to use the 1970 Clean Air Act to prevent the greenhouse gas emissions</a> that cause climate change. Overturning it is a big win for lobbyists and anyone else who might want to make it harder to crack down on industry through federal regulation. </p>\n<p id=\"DIKlHu\">“It would really unleash a kind of chaotic period of time where federal courts are deciding what they think all these laws mean. And that can lead to a lot of inconsistency and confusion for agencies and for regulated parties,” Jody Freeman, director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/20/24044179/supreme-court-chevron-doctrine-deference\">previously told <em>The Verg</em>e</a> when SCOTUS heard oral arguments over Chevron deference in January.</p>\n<p id=\"zZIAcR\">It’s called Chevron deference because of a 1984 ruling,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-1005\"><em>Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</em></a> (NRDC). In that case, the Supreme Court sided with Chevron rather than the environmental group NRDC — allowing the then industry-friendly Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan to stick with a more lax interpretation of the Clean Air Act. It shows how Chevron deference has been sort of politically agnostic in the past, even though the more recent push to overrule it has aligned with a deregulatory agenda. </p>\n<p id=\"6Bvohv\">In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that Chevron deference “has formed the backdrop against which Congress, courts, and agencies — as well as regulated parties and the public — all have operated for decades. It has been applied in thousands of judicial decisions. It has become part of the warp and woof of modern government, supporting regulatory efforts of all kinds — to name a few, keeping air and water clean, food and drugs safe, and financial markets honest.” Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined the dissent. (In a complicated little detail that doesn’t matter due to the sheer numbers the majority had, Justice Jackson’s dissenting vote only applies to <em>Relentless</em>, since she recused herself in <em>Loper Bright</em>.<em>)</em></p>\n<p id=\"1DlZ9r\">“If they toss Chevron out, the Court would be inviting unaccountable judges to freely impose their policy preferences over those of the political branches — exactly what Chevron sought to stop,” David Doniger, a senior adviser to the NRDC Action Fund and an attorney who litigated the 1984 case, said in a press briefing earlier this month.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"OKdz9z\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Why a Supreme Court decision on fishing boats could change everything\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/20/24044179/supreme-court-chevron-doctrine-deference\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"5WQkTK\">SCOTUS took up Chevron deference this year because of two cases brought by the fishing industry: <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em> and <em>Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce</em>. The plaintiffs challenged a federal rule that makes fishing companies pay for the cost of observers on vessels to monitor their operations, saying the National Marine Fisheries Service doesn’t actually have the authority to force them to pay because it’s not explicitly written into the fishery conservation statute. Lower courts upheld the mandate, applying Chevron deference. </p>\n<p id=\"v06QQi\">But there’s a lot more at stake with these cases than fishing boats. Trade groups representing a broad swath of interests from <a href=\"https://www.gunowners.org/goa-and-gof-file-amicus-brief-with-scotus-in-chevron-case/\">Gun Owners of America</a> to <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-451/272702/20230724125229569_Printer%20Ready%20Brief%20Jul%2020_v3.pdf\">e-cigarette companies</a> have all pushed to overturn or limit Chevron deference. </p>\n<p id=\"RYQCs8\">The fate of net neutrality in the US, for instance, has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/is-net-neutrality-doomed-at-supreme-court-fcc-and-isps-prepare-for-epic-battle/6/\">tied to Chevron deference</a>. Courts have <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1418&amp;context=faculty_articles\">previously deferred to the FCC</a> on how to define broadband. Is it considered a telecommunications or information service? If it’s telecommunications, then it’s subject to “common carrier” regulations and restrictions placed on public utilities to ensure fair access. The FCC has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/19/23922810/fcc-net-neutrality-proposed-rulemaking-vote\">flip-flopped</a> on the issue between the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations — with the FCC <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140157/fcc-vote-restore-net-neutrality-rosenworcel-biden\">deciding in April</a> to restore net neutrality rules. </p>\n<p id=\"TCWUBE\">The Supreme Court’s decision risks bogging down courts with all these nitty-gritty questions.

Also named in the suit were the company’s chief executive officer, chief risk officer, and chief financial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"kzjrqY\">Silvergate agreed to pay $50 million to settle the charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-82\">the SEC said in a statement.</a> CEO Alan Lane and CRO Kathleen Fraher also settled for $1 million and $250,000 each.</p>\n<p id=\"ZAW0rW\">Silvergate said it had an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program tailored specifically to crypto but actually didn’t adequately monitor “approximately $1 trillion” in transactions, the complaint says. Silvergate also didn’t notice “nearly $9 billion in suspicious transfers” by FTX entities.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"eA5oyf\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The trial and sentencing of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23894366/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-trial-updates-news\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"8dEuhg\">FTX was among Silvergate’s largest customers, the SEC says. Days after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23484331/ftx-explained-cryptocurrency-sbf-sam-bankman-fried\">the crypto exchange declared bankruptcy</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/4/23623964/crypto-silvergate-bank-run-stablecoins-dollars\">bank run that would ultimately kill Silvergate</a> had begun. Lane, aware of social media chatter about Silvergate, asked the bank to review its relationship with FTX. That review found more than 300 suspicious transactions in 2022. Those suspicious transfers totaled almost $9 billion, the SEC complaint says.</p>\n<p id=\"zeGnrA\">At that point, Silvergate’s chief financial officer Antonio Martino “engaged in a fraudulent scheme to mislead investors about the Bank’s dire financial condition,” the SEC alleges. Martino knew the bank had borrowed billions, which it would have to repay in January and February 2023. The only way that could happen would be by selling securities, but Martino approved an earnings release that “falsely stated the Bank expected to sell only $1.7 billion in securities during the First Quarter of 2023, of which it had already sold $1.5 billion.”</p>\n<p id=\"VdEGsU\">That earnings release understated Silvergate’s losses from its securities sales, the SEC complaint alleges. Martino also lied on the bank’s quarterly earnings call, according to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"yRgWUI\">Martino “categorically denies” these allegations, said his attorney, Adam Lurie, in a statement emailed to <em>The Verge </em>by Rachel Katz, a spokeswoman for Martino’s law firm Linklaters. “Mr. Martino acted reasonably and in good faith throughout his time at Silvergate. He denies any wrongdoing and intends to challenge the SEC’s claims in court,”  said Lurie, who was also directly quoted in a statement Katz said was his.</p>\n<p id=\"6lT0UI\">At the heart of the SEC’s allegations is the network Silvergate ran to allow crypto customers to transact at all hours, called SEN. This was used by, among others, stablecoin issuers such as Circle, Paxos, and Gemini. Though Silvergate said SEN was safe, the SEC says the network wasn’t being automatically monitored for suspicious transactions for “at least 15 months prior to November 2022.”</p>\n<p id=\"Cm3GJY\">What’s more, on several occasions in 2022, the bank’s government examiners made it clear to the C-suite that Silvergate’s program for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"gkGhas\">The earnings statement for the first quarter of 2023 wasn’t the only one alleged to contain fraud. In November 2022, the company suggested to investors that it had a “state-of-the-art” compliance program. In reality, the SEC says there was no automatic monitoring for several months before that earnings statement was released.</p>\n<p id=\"hDxHMq\"><em><strong>Update, July 1st:</strong></em><em> Added Linklater’s statement, SEC press release, and settlement details.</em></p>\n<div id=\"DMSwH1\">\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/24785653-945ca7a4-312d-4637-b202-31fd1bea57e4/?embed=1&amp;responsive=1&amp;title=1\" title=\"SEC Silvergate lawsuit (Hosted by DocumentCloud)\" width=\"309\" height=\"400\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px); max-height: 400px;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe>\n</div>"

Very little is known about the mysterious cryptocurrency creator, though they’re widely presumed to be the largest holder of Bitcoin, controlling an estimated 1.1 million BTC (worth roughly $77 billion at the time of writing).</p>\n<p id=\"qVPGeZ\">Satoshi’s identity was connected to Wright in reports published by <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692\"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/12/bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-this-unknown-australian-genius/\"><em>Wired</em></a> in 2015, though the latter publication noted that some of the clues that suggested Wright was the elusive Bitcoin creator were planted by Wright himself. Later reports from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/12/new-clues-suggest-satoshi-suspect-craig-wright-may-be-a-hoaxer/\"><em>Wired</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/jpgq3y/satoshis-pgp-keys-are-probably-backdated-and-point-to-a-hoax\"><em>Vice</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/12/11/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-craig-wright-lies-hoax/?platform=hootsuite\"><em>Forbes</em></a>, and other outlets also found inconsistencies in the evidence pointing to Wright being the creator of Bitcoin. </p>\n<p id=\"dcsw03\">Wright spent the following years aggressively attempting to prove that he is Satoshi: testifying on several occasions that he wrote the currency’s original white paper, challenging people developing Bitcoin-related projects, and filing defamation lawsuits against those who accused him of lying. Wright’s latest legal battle was instigated by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a nonprofit organization that sought to stop him from allegedly threatening developers by disproving his claim to Satoshi’s identity.</p>\n<div id=\"iqK5tF\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" align=\"center\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ICYMI: Our trial to prove, once and for all, that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto kicked off this week. Here’s a recap of the start of trial: <a href=\"https://t.co/xq64GmdmhD\">https://t.co/xq64GmdmhD</a></p>— COPA (@opencryptoorg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opencryptoorg/status/1755176549869867124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2024</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n</div>\n<p id=\"mg8oFn\"> COPA rejected Wright’s <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/dr-craig-wright-issues-settlement-offer-to-copa-members-and-all-parties-in-upcoming-intellectual-property-litigation-302043625.html\">offer to settle the case</a> in January, <a href=\"https://x.com/opencryptoorg/status/1750266477846905078\">alleging the deal</a> contained “loopholes that would allow him to sue people all over again.”</p>\n<p id=\"BFBcBm\">The case concluded on March 14th after a six-week investigation, with London High Court Judge James Mellor ruling that Wright didn’t create Bitcoin and is not Satoshi. “In both his written evidence and in days of oral evidence under cross-examination, I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the court extensively and repeatedly,” said Judge Mellor in the <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/COPA-v-Wright-Judgment.pdf\">231-page ruling</a> released this week. “In my judgment, he is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is.”</p>\n<p id=\"bq241J\">In his ruling, Judge Mellor said:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"mfx5rF\">Having considered all the evidence and submissions presented to me during the Trial, I reached the conclusion the evidence was overwhelming. At that point, I made certain declarations (because I was satisfied they are useful and are necessary to do justice between the parties), as follows:<br>First, that Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper. <br>Second, Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period between 2008 and 2011. <br>Third, Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system. <br>Fourth, Dr Wright is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin Software.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"QbdzCk\">Most of the forged evidence was “clumsy,” according to Mellor, who said that Wright frequently resorted to laying the blame on other (often unidentified) people or “what can only be described as technobabble delivered by him in the witness box” when his lies were exposed. “I tried to identify whether there was any reliable evidence to support Dr Wright’s claim and concluded there was <em>none</em>,” said Mellor, concluding that “the case that Dr Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto is overwhelming.”</p>\n<p id=\"AZmTTv\">The matter of injunctive relief will be argued in a future hearing. <a href=\"https://x.com/Dr_CSWright/status/1792525993359319235\">Wright says</a> he will appeal against the ruling “on the matter of the identity issue.”</p>"

The brothers — Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno — studied math and computer science at MIT and used the skills they had acquired “at one of the most prestigious universities in the country” to exploit “the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain in order to fraudulently obtain” the funds, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl\">prosecutors say</a>. The brothers were charged with<strong> </strong>wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>\n<p id=\"q9UOy7\">“Unfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for Department of Justice prosecutors and IRS agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-brothers-arrested-attacking-ethereum-blockchain-and-stealing-25m-cryptocurrency\">said in a press release</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"b1BHZC\">Though the heist was carried out in a matter of seconds, the brothers spent months plotting it, charging documents claim. The indictment claims that the Peraire-Bueno brothers “carefully planned and executed” the attack, beginning sometime in December 2022. The brothers allegedly created “an online document” laying out their four-step plan: 1) The Bait, 2) Unblinding the Block, 3) The Search, and 4) The Propagation.</p>\n<p id=\"ZDr7fv\">The brothers set up a series of Ethereum validators “in a manner that concealed their identities through the use of shell companies, intermediary cryptocurrency addresses, foreign exchanges, and a privacy layer network,” according to the indictment. They allegedly targeted three traders — whose behavior they had studied for months ahead of time, prosecutors claim — and set up “a series of test transactions or ‘bait transactions’” to attract bots the traders used.</p>\n<p id=\"3x2Lhw\">Prosecutors claim the brothers exploited a vulnerability in Etherum’s code that has since been patched. “In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims’ cryptocurrency,” the Department of Justice’s press release claims.</p>\n<p id=\"RuzoZu\">After stealing approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency, the Peraire-Bueno brothers allegedly laundered the funds through several shell companies. The brothers’ online search history in the weeks following the alleged theft included “top crypto lawyers,” “how long is us statue [sic] of limitations,” “fraudulent Ethereum access database,” and “money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.” Charging documents claim one victim and their lawyer repeatedly contacted the Peraire-Bueno brothers between April and June of 2023, as did a representative from Ethereum. </p>\n<p id=\"Ve98KH\">If convicted, each faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the three counts, according to the DOJ.</p>"

While the value of digital currencies like Bitcoin tumbled after FTX’s fall, they have since rebounded. That means some creditors feel they’re being shortchanged — since they’re getting dollars rather than digital assets back, and not as many dollars as the digital assets are currently worth.</p>\n<p id=\"O6A0LE\">“In reality [I] am only getting 25% of my Bitcoin back, and that will be over many years,” Arush Sehgal, a member of FTX’s unsecured creditors committee, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/ftx-has-billions-more-than-needed-to-repay-bankruptcy-victims?sref=M8H6LjUF\">tells <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>\n<p id=\"dNxU80\">The crypto exchange <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453164/ftx-bankruptcy-filing-sam-bankman-fried-resigns\">filed for bankruptcy in November 2022</a>, while former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried — who is now serving a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24112507/sam-bankman-fried-sentence-ftx-alameda\">25-year prison sentence</a> — resigned.

UnitedHealth <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/22/unitedhealth-paid-ransom-to-bad-actors-says-patient-data-was-compromised-in-change-healthcare-cyberattack.html\">admitted last month</a> that it had paid a ransom to the hackers who breached the Change Healthcare system — which is owned by UnitedHealth — but didn’t disclose the sum. In March, the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24087105/united-health-black-cat-ransom-ware-hospitals-payments\">attributed the breach to BlackCat</a>, the same entity responsible for the MGM casino hack in Las Vegas. That same month, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/alphv-change-healthcare-ransomware-payment/\"><em>Wired</em> reported</a> that BlackCat, which also goes by ALPHV, received a $22 million transaction on Bitcoin on March 1st.</p>\n<p id=\"1uJV1B\">BlackCat previously claimed it netted more than six terabytes of data as part of the hack, which it carried out in February of this year. The ransomware gang said the data included “sensitive” medical records, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-describes-devastating-effects-unitedhealth-cyberattack-change-healthcare/\">according to CBS News</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"7o7opm\">“Criminals used compromised credentials to remotely access Change Healthcare Citrix portal, an application used to enable remote access to desktops,” Witty said during his testimony, adding that the portal “did not have multifactor authentication.” </p>\n<p id=\"aOP9mJ\">“This hack could’ve been stopped with cybersecurity 101,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the chair of the committee. After Witty confirmed United will require multifactor authentication companywide going forward, Wyden said it “shouldn’t have taken the worst cyberattack ever in the healthcare sector for an agreement to do this bare minimum.”</p>\n<p id=\"ZFkA39\">The effects of the hack were far-reaching. After the breach was discovered, United shut down the Change Healthcare system for a week, which prevented hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies across the country from getting paid. During the hearing, Witty said the system is now “broadly back to normal.” But some senators told Witty that hospitals and other healthcare providers are still waiting on payments. Wyden (D-OR) told Witty that some providers who filed claims in February were told they’d have to wait until June to get paid.</p>\n<p id=\"hqr3SG\">UnitedHealth manages more than one-third of all patient records in the US and oversees 1 in 10 doctors across the country, according to <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/lettercomment/2024-02-26-aha-letter-hhs-implications-change-healthcare-cyberattack\">a letter</a> the American Hospital Association sent to the Department of Health and Human Services in March. In his opening remarks, Wyden called United a “healthcare leviathan” and described the hack as a “dire warning about the consequences of too-big-to-fail mega-corporations.”</p>"

Bankman-Fried got 25 years; Zhao got four months.</p>\n<p id=\"tkQeXp\">There’s more. Zhao appeared in court in a tailored navy suit with a light blue tie when he spoke in his own defense. Bankman-Fried was shackled and in prison garb.</p>\n<p id=\"6n0N5B\">Bankman-Fried defrauded people, pleaded not guilty, repeatedly perjured himself in court, got convicted on seven counts, and then gave an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/29/24114864/sam-bankman-fried-trial-sentencing-lessons-ftx\">absolutely bizarre speech</a> during his own sentencing hearing that made the judge think he’d be likely to re-offend. (This is to say nothing of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html\">his pretrial antics</a>.) By contrast, Zhao pleaded guilty in a deal with the government and expressed contrition. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"0IWme7\"><q>I was struck by repeated references to a sealed matter and significant emphasis on the word “cooperation”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"x4fU7c\">Yes, those things are for sure different. But are they <em>more than 24 years</em> different?</p>\n<p id=\"Ei5MqF\">Zhao’s guilty plea — to one count with a maximum sentencing guideline of 18 months — was the result of a pretty sweet deal. He also had to pay a mere multimillion-dollar fine (a pittance to a man worth an estimated <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2024/04/02/the-richest-crypto-and-bitcoin-billionaires-in-the-world-2024/?sh=28e708f3726b\">$33 billion</a>) and step down as CEO of Binance. But during his hearing, I was struck by repeated references to a sealed matter that was a mitigating factor on sentencing and significant emphasis on the word “cooperation.”</p>\n<p id=\"usoLJi\">If the government had <em>wanted</em> to throw the book at Zhao, it probably could have. The government’s sentencing memo alleges sanctions violations amounting to more than a billion dollars on Binance. In court, Judge Richard Jones made reference to “billions of dollars of Bitcoin” transacted with “darkweb markets.” The amounts were so significant that the government asked for <em>twice</em> the amount of time recommended by the sentencing guideline. </p>\n<p id=\"IXkizH\">Zhao is one of the richest men on Earth and can afford the best lawyers money can buy. No doubt they worked wonders for him. But the US government is also a very powerful entity, and the court filings made in this case, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749480/sec-sues-binance-crypto-exchange-changpeng-zhao\">the SEC case</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/27/23659109/binance-cftc-vpn-signal-notes\">the CFTC case suggest</a> it had ahold of some <em>very</em> damning stuff written by Zhao himself. So the fact that Zhao managed to make a bargain where he copped to <em>one</em> charge — with a short sentence! — seems significant. It suggests he had some leverage.</p>\n<p id=\"sGE6zc\">Naturally, I wonder what it was. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"FiUcXt\"><q>The exact nature of Zhao’s cooperation is likely what’s under seal</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"8Fb8h5\">As a part of the agreement, Binance now has an “independent compliance monitor” inside the company. I assume that means every governmental alphabet soup agency now has eyes on every trade made on the exchange, both in the past and for the next three years, along with identifying information as required by the exciting new anti-money laundering measures at Binance. That kind of surveillance is not <em>nothing</em> for the United States government.</p>\n<p id=\"xalRSg\">But on the other hand, terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and ISIS, traded Bitcoin on Binance. So, too, did the military arm of Hamas.</p>\n<p id=\"cg2uFv\">Sure, there’s no evidence that Zhao <em>knew</em> those groups — as well as hackers, money launderers, and other unsavory characters — were trading on Binance. He just didn’t care who was trading there as long as the business grew. The exact nature of Zhao’s cooperation is likely what’s under seal, but the scale of alleged criminals trading on Binance suggests that Zhao’s information must be significant, maybe even geopolitically significant.</p>\n<p id=\"EuayuM\">I don’t know if it’s Iran or North Korea, though plausibly, there could be useful information on both of those countries. In court, I found myself wondering if there’s information on China up for grabs as well. </p>\n<p id=\"EhyhhO\">The US’s rivalry with China has only been heating up over the last several years — the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/7/23392860/biden-semiconductor-chips-intel-micron-china-ohio-science\">AI chip ban is only the latest part of the saga</a>. It’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/china-users-move-50-billion-of-cryptocurrency-out-of-country-hinting-at-capital-flight.html\">an open secret</a> that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-platforms-part-of-illegal-chinese-forex-ring-report\">cryptocurrency</a> is a major avenue of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.economist.com%2Ffinance-and-economics%2F2023%2F12%2F14%2Fhow-to-sneak-billions-of-dollars-out-of-china&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F5%2F1%2F24145736%2Fbinance-cz-changpeng-zhao-plea-agreement\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese capital flight</a>, even though <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/bruised-by-stock-market-chinese-rush-into-banned-bitcoin-2024-01-25/\">crypto is banned</a> in mainland China. I can imagine a world in which a valuable intelligence target is told to cooperate with the US if they don’t want their illegal Bitcoin reported to the Chinese government. </p>\n<p id=\"6P2px0\">Whatever that information is, it’s significant enough to get Zhao only four months in prison, while Bankman-Fried will languish for most of his adult life. Zhao is one of the wealthiest men in the world, and there aren’t a lot of things bigger than he is to be worth that kind of sweetheart deal. But maybe that’s also part of the message the US wants to send: cooperate <em>or else.</em></p>"

Zhao, once the head of the largest crypto exchange in the world, pleaded guilty in November 2023.</p>\n<p id=\"Oi822P\">Judge Richard Jones says that Zhao prioritized “Binance’s growth and profits over compliance with US laws and regulations.” While Jones doesn’t think Zhao is likely to reoffend, the scale of the crime is notable. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"FCC9St\"><q>Binance “violated US law on an unprecedented scale”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"p4Zh6X\">Though Zhao is not as well-known as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23894366/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-trial-updates-news\">FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, he is a more important figure in the crypto world. The Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur founded Binance in 2017. Though he was required to step down as CEO of the exchange as part of his plea agreement, he is still the controlling shareholder of the company, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-23/binance-bnb-ceo-moves-to-dubai-as-us-regulators-target-the-crypto-exchange?sref=M8H6LjUF\">one person told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> was “a massive shitcoin casino.” Binance listed many more tokens than competitors such as Coinbase.</p>\n<p id=\"tscnEy\">Prosecutors requested three years of prison time, double the sentencing guideline of 18 months, because the “scope and ramifications of Zhao’s misconduct were massive,” <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570.78.0.pdf\">they wrote in their sentencing memo</a>. They also suggested that Zhao’s sentence should “reflect the significant harm to US national security caused by his criminal acts.”</p>\n<p id=\"H6o8DK\">Binance allowed sanctions violations of more than $898 million, according to prosecutors, and “violated US law on an unprecedented scale.” Zhao and other Binance executives didn’t comply with US laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and didn’t adequately implement anti-money laundering efforts. As a result, Iranian customers were able to transact at least $1.1 million with US customers in violation of sanctions. Other sanctioned countries, such as Cuba and Syria, were able to transact as well.</p>\n<p id=\"EqkNwT\">Zhao’s lawyers, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570.81.0.pdf\">in their own sentencing memo,</a> said that Zhao deserved no jail time, as “no defendant in a remotely similar BSA case has ever been sentenced to incarceration.” Zhao traveled from his home in the UAE to enter his guilty plea. He has remained in the US “away from his home, partner, and young children for five and a half months,” his lawyers wrote. Besides, Binance has taken action to fix their anti-money laundering procedures, they wrote.</p>\n<p id=\"mQ5qva\">In the crypto world, Zhao has long been known as a cowboy with a reputation for flouting US laws. In October 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of rival exchange FTX, tweeted (and deleted) that he was “excited to see [Zhao] repping the industry in DC going forward! uh, he is still allowed to go to DC, right?” A week after that, Zhao tweeted he’d sell his holdings of FTX’s token <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23498823/coindesk-ftx-dcg-barry-silbert-grayscale-genesis\">in response to a blockbuster story in <em>CoinDesk</em></a>. Since Binance had been an early investor in FTX, that was a pretty sizable amount. “We won’t support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs,” Zhao <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1589374530413215744\">said</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"Vc4LRm\">By publicly broadcasting his trade, Zhao began the run on FTX that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23459268/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-bankruptcy-crypto-lobbying-washington\">eventually revealed the fraud at the exchange</a>. Bankman-Fried was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/29/24114864/sam-bankman-fried-trial-sentencing-lessons-ftx\">sentenced to 25 years in prison in March</a> after being found guilty in a jury trial of seven counts of conspiracy and fraud charges.</p>\n<p id=\"Y1R0n3\">Zhao has already agreed to pay a fine of $50 million, a pittance compared to the estimated <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2024/04/02/the-richest-crypto-and-bitcoin-billionaires-in-the-world-2024/?sh=28e708f3726b\">$33 billion fortune</a> he made with Binance. He also agreed not to appeal any sentence up to 18 months.</p>"

The new trim will be available for $42,490, according to the website. </p>\n<p id=\"1Wq2yJ\">The rear-wheel-drive (RWD) version of the Long Range Model 3 will get an EPA-estimated range of 363 miles. That could be a significant addition to Tesla’s lineup at a time when <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/2/24187320/tesla-q2-2024-production-deliveries-decline\">production and sales are both drooping</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"zk8tjx\">Tesla originally introduced the Long Range RWD Model 3 in 2017 but discontinued it two years later. Now, it’s back with a new sticker price and a new look, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032562/tesla-model-3-2024-refresh-us-available-highland\">a refreshed design</a> that launched in the US at the beginning of the year. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cV6jDwmjNlDsxnfuiIxHK4etf3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25528106/Screenshot_2024_07_12_at_10.25.56_AM.png\">\n      <cite>Screenshot: Tesla</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"yfwHUL\">The new trim is almost $5,000 cheaper than the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Long Range Model 3, but also $3,500 more than the standard-range RWD Model 3. It also has about 100 miles more range than the base Model 3, so keep that in mind, too. </p>\n<p id=\"VDTr5q\">Something else to keep in mind: Tesla has been accused of overestimating its range figures for a while now. A report from last year found there was a lot of elasticity in how Tesla calculates its range, which often results in unrealistic numbers. </p>\n<p id=\"ZhYSDD\">But when you factor in the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, the new Long Range RWD version hits that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569524/tesla-model-3-35000-price-stop-selling\">mythical $35,000 mark</a> that Tesla originally promised when the Model 3 was first introduced in 2017. </p>\n<p id=\"IIsgSo\">The price even got Tesla CEO Elon Musk excited. </p>\n<div id=\"S53mjg\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" align=\"center\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New Tesla Model 3 version available in America. <br><br>363 miles of range for $35k! <a href=\"https://t.co/1L4kCB0Ww8\">https://t.co/1L4kCB0Ww8</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1811768409455026445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2024</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n</div>"

Musk has yet to post anything about the delay on X. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"U2al8s\"><q>So much for August</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"Nrly7v\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24134282/tesla-earnings-q1-2024-profit-demand-elon-musk\">At an earnings call</a> earlier this year, Musk reiterated his belief that Tesla is not a traditional car company but, actually, an AI and robotics company. Facing pointed questions from investors about affordable EVs, Musk responded, “Really, we should be thought of as an AI robotics company. If you value Tesla as just an auto company ... that’s just the wrong framework.” </p>\n<p id=\"XVGHsh\">Musk has been teasing the possibility of a Tesla robotaxi for a long time. He speculated that Tesla owners would be able to earn revenue from their personally owned autonomous cars by sending them out to pick up and drop off passengers. And the company even previewed <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138580/tesla-robotaxi-ride-hail-app-preview-earningsq1-2024\">a ridehailing function</a> built into Tesla’s app. </p>\n<p id=\"dJx5m8\">But many of Musk’s predictions about fully autonomous vehicles have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23837598/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-false-promises-land-of-the-giants\">failed to come true</a>. Today, Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems require drivers to pay attention to the road and be ready to take control when needed. Drivers are also liable for any crashes that occur when the driver assist is engaged — and the company is in the midst of fighting <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/11/24097480/tesla-walter-huang-crash-lawsuit-court-autopilot\">several wrongful death lawsuits</a> that have stemmed from fatal crashes. </p>\n<p id=\"F27ilp\">Meanwhile, Waymo and several other companies are currently operating fully autonomous robotaxis in several US cities. </p>\n<p id=\"GyZgr4\">In the earnings report, Tesla said the robotaxi will be “purpose built,” which is a term used in the autonomous vehicle industry to describe vehicles built from the ground up to be self-driving and that often lack traditional controls like steering wheels and pedals.</p>\n<p id=\"IuIuUM\"></p>"

Tesla reported delivering 443,956 vehicles to customers during Q2 of 2024, a 4.76 percent drop from the 466,140 vehicles it delivered in Q2 2023. </p>\n<p id=\"Zrzo8a\">This continues a trend that began earlier this year in which Tesla reported its first year-over-year <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24118950/tesla-q1-2024-sales-decline-ev-competition-ford-gm\">sales drop since 2020</a>. The company is continuing to struggle with demand as customers have more choices than ever when shopping for an electric vehicle. It did turn around last quarter’s sequential drop in deliveries, with an increase of 14.8 percent compared to Q1.</p>\n<p id=\"WxKaMj\">Tesla has also been dealing with some real struggles that have affected its production, like the ramp-up of the newly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032562/tesla-model-3-2024-refresh-us-available-highland\">refreshed Model 3</a> at its factory in Fremont, California, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-shut-down-production-german-plant-4-days-handelsblatt-2024-05-07/\">shutdowns related to supply chain issues</a> at its Gigafactory in Berlin. </p>\n<p id=\"ZUYxQT\">But production woes can’t totally explain the drop in customer deliveries. Tesla’s market share has shrunk as legacy automakers continue to release new models. It’s now hovering at around 50 percent of the market, down from 80 percent share in 2020. And while other automakers are reporting double-digit growth in EV sales, Tesla’s sales continue to drop. </p>\n<p id=\"wbK4Dh\">There’s a litany of reasons for this: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24119918/elon-musk-reputation-impact-tesla-falling-sales\">Musk’s online antics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/29/23529744/tesla-elon-musk-year-review-stock-price-cybertruck-delays\">gaps</a> in the company’s vehicle lineup, and increasing competition. The vast majority of Tesla’s sales — over 90 percent — come from just two models: the Model 3 and Model Y. The Cybertruck, the company’s great stainless steel hope, is extremely polarizing and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24134753/tesla-recall-cybertruck-faulty-accelerator-pedal-nhtsa-defect\">perennially</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185472/tesla-cybertruck-recall-faulty-wiper-trim\">recalled</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"F5QJi8\">Tesla doesn’t break out its numbers regionally, so it’s impossible to pinpoint the company’s major weaknesses. Registration trackers indicate Europe is a growing problem. But China, Tesla’s most important market, may be looking up thanks to lowered interest rates and new incentives. </p>\n<p id=\"r57c7l\">It’s looking like it will be a busy summer for Tesla. As it continues to sift through the wreckage of this year’s multiple rounds of layoffs, the company is expected to report its second quarter earnings later this month. And then, on August 8th, there’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138580/tesla-robotaxi-ride-hail-app-preview-earningsq1-2024\">the big robotaxi reveal</a>, where Musk will make his most forceful pitch for Tesla’s future as an AI and robotics company. </p>\n<p id=\"2Bv5C2\">That may be the future, but the present is still cars. </p>"

Last week, dozens of Tesla Cybertrucks were defaced with the words “Fuck Elon” in black spray paint, <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/724187/tesla-cybertruck-vandals-fudge-elon/\">according to <em>InsideEVs</em></a><em> </em>citing <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/local/2024/06/22/f-elon-rows-of-tesla-cybertrucks-vandalized-in-fort-lauderdale/\">local news reports</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"egAj0F\">Police say that 34 stainless steel trucks were tagged with the message, which was discovered on Friday. The Cybertrucks were being stored in the public parking lot, without any fencing or security, likely being held because of a previously <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180519/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-windshield-wiper-issue\">reported problem</a> with the windshield wiper. Tesla is also experiencing an inventory pileup as a result of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24134282/tesla-earnings-q1-2024-profit-demand-elon-musk\">cooling demand</a> for its electric vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"kZGn04\">Local news reports that the spray paint was easily removed, with a few trucks still showing some black smudges. But thanks to a few social media accounts, we can still experience the uncensored images as much (or as little) as we want. </p>\n<div id=\"Ru2XZj\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8fKw4HOn_S/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

On Thursday, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1803788430012187075\">Musk reposted a chart</a> that claims Europe is suffering from a “fertility crisis,” saying “civilization may end with a bang or with a whimper (in adult diapers).”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"9Nkkji\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Fired SpaceX workers sue Elon Musk for sexual harassment and retaliation\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177095/spacex-elon-musk-sexual-harassment-lawsuit\"},{\"title\":\"Elon Musk&amp;nbsp;has unusual relationships with women at SpaceX, WSJ reports\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176705/spacex-elon-musk-gwynne-shotwell-sexual-relationships\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"rMeYya\">As noted by <em>Bloomberg</em>, Musk has repeated that line several times in the past, including during a 2022 interview with Tucker Carlson and again during an interview at the Milken Institute conference in May. He told Carlson “a collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces, by far.” In 2021, Musk’s nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-14/elon-musk-s-10m-texas-donation-funds-a-favorite-topic-of-his-fertility\">donated $10 million to the University of Austin</a> to fund the Population Wellbeing Initiative, a research group that studies the human population.</p>\n<p id=\"B53J48\">The revelation also follows multiple reports alleging inappropriate conduct from Musk in the workplace and with subordinates. A recent report from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176705/spacex-elon-musk-gwynne-shotwell-sexual-relationships\">said Musk had a sexual relationship</a> with a former SpaceX intern who later became one of the company’s executives. Another employee says she refused Musk’s requests to have children with him several times, according to the <em>Journal</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"66LcOZ\">Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177095/spacex-elon-musk-sexual-harassment-lawsuit\">eight former SpaceX engineers</a> filed a lawsuit against Musk that claims the billionaire “knowingly and purposefully created an unwelcome hostile work environment based upon his conduct of interjecting into the workplace vile sexual photographs, memes, and commentary that demeaned women and/or the LGBTQ+ community.” The complaint echoes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092721/spacex-lawsuit-sexual-bias-harassment-pay-inequity\">past allegations</a> of discrimination and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22831380/spacex-employees-harassment-workplace-misconduct-elon-musk\">sexual harassment</a> at SpaceX, including an incident where <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/19/23131680/elon-musk-sexual-misconduct-accusations-spacex-flight-attendant\">Musk allegedly propositioned a flight attendant</a> for sex.</p>\n<p id=\"oeLxcS\"></p>"

And that’s for good reason: it’s been moving so rapidly and changing so often that it’s nearly impossible for the average person to keep up. Making sense of all the different players, who’s building what, and what people in the industry honestly think about where it’s all going — it’s a lot.</p>\n<div id=\"z88tU6\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP4000471261\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p id=\"Gerrwu\">So, we thought it would be a good idea to take a beat and have Alex and Kylie break down the modern AI boom as it exists today: the companies you need to know, the most important news of the last few months, and what it’s actually like to be fully immersed in this industry every single day.</p>\n<p id=\"HpIfgx\">You’ll hear Alex and Kylie talk about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157818/google-openai-search-chatgpt-ai-race\">OpenAI, the gravitational pull it’s had</a> on the entire tech sector, and how Google is trying to challenge that — to mixed results. But they also got into the relationship between the overzealous hype driving AI funding and product development and the very real paranoia in the Bay Area around what you’ll hear Kylie refer to as <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90994526/pdoom-explained-how-to-calculate-your-score-on-ai-apocalypse-metric\">p(doom)</a>, shorthand for the probability percentage that AI might actually kill us all. </p>\n<p id=\"7Lgyp5\">They also break down all the most important AI companies, how likely it is some smaller AI startup unseats ChatGPT,  the open vs. closed source debate, and — as Alex puts it — the “Wall Street-ification” of AI.  </p>\n<p id=\"xU71DB\">Oh, and look out for a mention of an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-06/effective-accelerationism-and-beff-jezos-form-new-tech-tribe\">effective accelerationist</a> rave where Grimes DJ’d for the CTO of OpenAI.

In the case of Tesla, he is probably responsible for its survival in a dicey period following the 2008 financial crisis. His <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22421873/elon-musk-snl-jokes-thud-why\">involvement and fame</a> have allowed Tesla to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22426978/elon-musk-snl-electric-vehicle-commercials-tesla-saturday-night-live\">save significant money on advertising</a>. For this service, Tesla shareholders voted him a massive pay package in 2018 — which was<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24056177/elon-musk-tesla-tornetta-55-billion-pay-package-rejected\"> struck down by a judge in the state of Delaware</a>, where Tesla is incorporated, because shareholders were not adequately informed that many of Tesla’s theoretically independent directors weren’t that independent at all.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"gTjB8J\"><q>It’s clear that Musk modeled himself on Steve Jobs</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"hSt1h1\">Perhaps I should say: where Tesla <em>was</em> incorporated. Because <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177128/tesla-elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote\">in the shareholder vote</a> that reapproved the pay package, Tesla’s relocation to Texas won. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177656/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-massive-pay-package-was-there-ever-any-doubt\">Just like Elon Musk wanted</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"ETVc6w\">I doubt I am the only person that watches Musk closely; certainly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427006/dogecoin-crashing-elon-musk-snl-host\">there are those</a> who have viewed him as a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?sref=M8H6LjUF\">top signal for trading</a>. His job cuts at Twitter were <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-blackout-protest-private-ceo-elon-musk-huffman-rcna89700\">used as an excuse for other job cuts elsewhere</a>, for instance. (Musk is, in his way, Silicon Valley’s Tiberius, ruling from afar and consumed with paranoia; who might be his Sejanus I’ll leave to the reader.) </p>\n<p id=\"28TheD\">His weird and at times scandalous behavior has largely been allowed because investing in Musk has been so lucrative for so many people over the last 20-odd years. Though Musk’s adventures in social media ownership have somewhat threatened this reputation — at least <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc0b6534-c1b6-4979-bc21-30c1ff4594a2\">for those left holding Twitter’s debt</a> — he nonetheless managed to raise $6 billion for xAI, his <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24080217/elon-musk-xai-fundraising-grok-ai\">somewhat aimless</a> AI company that may or may not rely on (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177975/tesla-shareholder-lawsuit-elon-musk-xai-rival-compete\">and compete with</a>) Tesla itself.</p>\n<p id=\"IwlHlk\">Musk’s celebrity was built, first, in Hollywood — as the model for Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal of Marvel superhero Iron Man. But he then cultivated a following on Twitter and at in-person events for the faithful, making himself extraordinarily available to his fans in a way most CEOs, even celebrity CEOs, are not. As time has gone on, he has become more demanding of <a href=\"https://x.com/sawyermerritt/status/1770544352592294386?s=46&amp;t=5fphZMdXgc54t6mo9ReYMQ\">the high priests</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505744/elon-musk-fans-tesla-spacex-fandom\">his fandom</a> — threatening to <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1785405979573514425\">cut them off</a> for linking to reporting he doesn’t like, for instance.</p>\n<p id=\"ZPlOC0\">It’s clear that Musk modeled himself on Steve Jobs, who was also controlling, temperamental, and publicity-obsessed. But Musk’s refinements to the model led to a kind of power that even Jobs didn’t have at Apple: an empire of companies, the biggest pay package of all time, and political influence. The fandom aspect here is what makes this all work — the shareholder vote in Musk’s favor was swung by retail shareholders, who <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178442/the-shareholders-are-givers\">overwhelmingly approved</a> his pay package.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"dYpqm2\"><q>Tesla is less a meme stock than, say, GameStop or AMC but it has some similarities</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"o9yerm\">Sure, some of these people are true believers — we heard from many of them at the shareholder meeting, thanking Musk for his contributions to society. But I don’t think every single Tesla holder is a purist. This is the stock market; plenty of people just want to make money.</p>\n<p id=\"4YY7ce\">Retail investing has been on the rise since the original internet bubble in the 1990s. Following the events of 2008, many people were convinced that Wall Street was nothing more than a casino, that stock prices (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23697708/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-investing-tech\">and company valuations</a>) were mostly manipulated, and that there was no other way besides gambling on stock to become wealthy enough to retire. This kind of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo\">financial nihilism resulted</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks\">meme stock trading</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377175/gamestop-eat-the-rich-diamond-hands-roaring-kitty-elon-musk-netflix\">Musk himself has dabbled in</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"3Vm7u7\">Tesla is less a meme stock than, say, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street\">GameStop</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-reddit-renegades-helped-theater-giant-amc-avoid-a-tragic-ending-11614358803\">AMC</a> but it <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/elon-musk-tesla-meme-stock-by-j-bradford-delong-2024-05\">has some similarities</a>: Musk can move the price through posting to the company formerly known as Twitter, for instance. A lot of Tesla’s premium over other carmakers has to do with its story: the energy company of the future, not just a carmaker. That story is intimately tied to Musk; while I can imagine another CEO giving Tesla their undivided attention, someone who can serve as the excellent operator of a car company likely won’t have the same “energy of the future” story attached. And stocks, being about the future, are about stories. Musk leaving could nuke Tesla’s premium.</p>\n<p id=\"04rxk4\">I have heard people say that they thought voting for Musk’s pay and relocation meant shareholders were voting against their own interests. Well, maybe. But let’s say you’ve been paying attention to the last several years’ worth of corporate governance: your <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22585805/adam-neumann-cult-of-we-wework-book-vc\">WeWorks</a>, your <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144317/elon-musk-supreme-court-twitter-sitter-sec-tesla\">SEC battles with Musk</a>, Uber’s board’s blind eye to Travis Kalanick’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/technology/uber-workplace-culture.html\">reckless</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html\">leadership</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18518176/boeing-737-max-crash-problems-human-error-mcas-faa\">Boeing in general</a>, (This is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27eddb59-1770-4ad8-a07f-6a940e20e00c\">to say nothing of the phenomenon</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166644/vivek-ramaswamy-buzzfeed-letter-shares\">founder control</a>.) You might come away with the impression that corporate governance exists in name only.</p>\n<p id=\"h1yO4K\">A cynic might conclude there is no reason to remove Musk, or even object to his wildest behavior, as long as he continues making money for shareholders. Even maintaining the Musk story premium might be reason enough. If Musk is upset, he might not make money for shareholders anymore — and, indeed, may compete with Tesla using his new company, xAI. Lawsuits take a long time to work their way through the court system, and have uncertain outcomes; in the meantime, Tesla can be badly hurt by Musk’s petulance. The shareholder vote makes sense if you believe corporate governance isn’t real and everything is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"bt6yJZ\"></p>\n<p id=\"A7LUJu\"></p>"

No other details were divulged. Sure, Musk was in a giddy mood considering his shareholders just handed him a victory by reapproving his enormous $50 billion compensation package. But even the world’s most hyperbolic CEO stayed tight-lipped about what was in the pipeline. </p>\n<p id=\"ZziHi5\">So let’s speculate. One of those vehicles is probably the robotaxi, which Musk has said will get a proper reveal on August 8th. He even gave it a new name during a recent earnings call: “Cybercab.” </p>\n<p id=\"o9hmpk\">Which one do we think is the robotaxi? I’m guessing it’s the one on the far right, closest to the Cybertruck. Musk is going to want to pair his two most futuristic vehicles together like two low-poly peas in a pod. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HIUPOIjpa8gPq3IlQzfYXi3K60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25491344/lcimg_98fe6c3f_c8a1_4fa2_a71a_91850f6f4a11.png\">\n      <cite>Image: Tesla</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>A slide from last year’s Master Plan Part 3 presentation. </em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"iWbS3n\">But then again, maybe the robotaxi is the more van-shaped vehicle on the left. If this is Tesla’s first purpose-built autonomous vehicle, the one made for the ridehailing network that Musk has described as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138580/tesla-robotaxi-ride-hail-app-preview-earningsq1-2024\">a cross between Uber and Airbnb</a>, wouldn’t they want something a bit more high capacity — something that can squeeze in more passengers than a Model Y? Waymo’s first robotaxi was a Chrysler Pacifica minivan. It would be pretty hilarious if Tesla followed suit by introducing its own robot van. </p>\n<p id=\"9ahU2u\">During the presentation, a shareholder asked Musk whether he would make a more high volume electric van with enough room for 13 passengers. Musk laughed and said he would “add it to my list.”</p>\n<p id=\"0lyxal\">Tesla has dropped hints about a van before. In its <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux\">Master Plan Part Deux</a>, the company said it was developing “high passenger-density urban transport” and also suggested that autonomous buses could be deployed. I happen to think both of those ideas are fully dead given Musk’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-awkward-dislike-mass-transit/\">notorious disdain for public transportation</a>. But in <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/Tesla-Master-Plan-Part-3.pdf\">Master Plan Part 3</a>, the company lists “bus” and “commercial/passenger vans” as “TBD.” So maybe it’s not dead?</p>\n<p id=\"ow0juG\">So, if the robotaxi is on the right and the boxy vehicle on the left is some kind of van, what’s that vehicle in the upper left? Could it be the long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085495/tesla-roadster-is-coming-no-really\">refreshed Tesla Roadster</a>? Or is it some kind of compact, more affordable “Model 2”? </p>\n<p id=\"EnzOxj\">The saga of the Model 2 — a name that Musk has never confirmed — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122064/tesla-cancel-affordable-electric-vehicle-model-2-china\">has been a rollercoaster</a>. Tesla bulls and investors have been trying to will it into existence for years, even though Musk has never really been fully on board. Even as far back as the Master Plan Part Deux (released in 2016), Musk said that a lower-cost vehicle cheaper than the Model 3 “is unlikely to be necessary.”</p>\n<p id=\"CqI0D2\">Earlier this year, Musk was basically bullied by investors into <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138646/tesla-q1-2024-earnings-model-2-affordable-electric-vehicles\">recommitting to the Model 2</a>, promising lower-cost models in the years to come. But the man is clearly tired of running a car company. </p>\n<p id=\"E1xlTQ\">To him, AI and robots are the future. During yesterday’s presentation, he spent several minutes excitedly discussing Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots — while barely paying lip service to the company’s actual vehicular products. In his mind, Tesla’s future won’t be rolling on four wheels but, rather, walking on two legs. </p>"

Investors also approved a proposal to move the company’s legal home from Delaware to Texas and to reappoint two board members: James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother. </p>\n<p id=\"cuUkZo\">The vote was widely seen as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177128/tesla-elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote\">a referendum on Musk’s leadership</a> during a time of great upheaval for Tesla, which has seen its stock price slide on news of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24134781/tesla-q1-2024-earnings-sales-market-share-elon-musk\">shrinking sales, softening demand, and declining revenue</a>. The company has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/6/24150274/tesla-layoffs-employee-fourth-week-elon-musk-ev-demand\">laid off at least 10 percent</a> of its workforce, its vehicle lineup is aging and in need of a shake-up, and the success of Musk’s bet on AI and robotics is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141361/tesla-autopilot-fsd-nhtsa-investigation-report-crash-death\">far from certain</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"5ILyOK\">In spite of all this, Tesla shareholders handed him an enormous victory by approving a compensation package that would make him one of the highest paid chief executives in modern history. </p>\n<p id=\"stream-entry-f04a210b-39a0-4349-9747-8d3097dda35a\">“I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys,” Musk said, after taking the stage with this arms raised in victory. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"Uz5NFw\"><q>“I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"1t81ac\">In some ways, the outcome was entirely predictable. Shareholders clearly wanted to reward Musk’s effort to transform Tesla into the most valuable car company in the world, creating enormous wealth for them in the process. And they wanted to refute those who have questioned his leadership choices in recent years, especially as his attention has wandered to other ventures, like the company formerly known as Twitter. </p>\n<p id=\"FP6tPL\">Tesla has an unusually high proportion of retail investors — also known as mom-and-pop investors — compared to large institutional investors. And while several top proxy advisory firms <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170368/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-shareholder-meeting\">have recommended voting against</a> the proposal, the company’s retail shareholders clearly disagreed. </p>\n<p id=\"oGG3RL\">Even recent negative revelations, like allegations of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176705/spacex-elon-musk-gwynne-shotwell-sexual-relationships\">sexual misconduct by Musk</a> at SpaceX and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177095/spacex-elon-musk-sexual-harassment-lawsuit\">sexual harassment lawsuit</a> by fired employees, weren’t enough to affect the outcome. Nor has his political <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/elon-musk-has-made-x-more-right-leaning-study-shows\">shift to the right</a> and his endorsement of many <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24111405/elon-musk-great-replacement-conspiracy-immigration-don-lemon\">unhinged conspiracy theories</a> on X. Many investors simply didn’t want to risk the value of their shares plummeting if the pay package was rejected. </p>\n<p id=\"djMreh\">But Musk can’t just take the money and run. The Delaware court’s ruling striking down his pay package, on the grounds that Musk had undue influence over its composition, still stands. Today’s vote was part of an unusual strategy by Tesla to correct the flaws in the process that first began in 2018. </p>\n<p id=\"k24kYH\">“It is not automatically reinstated if the shareholders approve it,” said Samantha Crispin, a partner at Texas-based law firm Baker Botts and chair of the corporate department. “I would imagine it would be influential [and] it certainly would be something that the judge would take into consideration.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"p0ZnU9\"><q>But Musk can’t just take the money and run</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"31Cm31\">Tesla is banking on the reapproval aiding in its effort to overturn Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick’s ruling, which means a likely appeal to the state’s Supreme Court. Still, the outcome is uncertain, with Tesla stating in its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a.htm\">proxy statement</a> that it “cannot predict with certainty how a vote to ratify Musk’s compensation would be treated under Delaware law in these novel circumstances.”</p>\n<p id=\"DbeVsO\">Still, the vote could help keep Musk’s attention on Tesla — as well as its work on AI and robotics. Earlier this year, Musk threatened to spin out the automaker’s work on artificial intelligence into a separate company if he did not receive 25 percent control of Tesla’s stock. He sold approximately $38 billion worth of Tesla stock in 2021–2022 to finance his acquisition of Twitter and now heads six other companies. With today’s vote, Musk’s stake could potentially rise to 20 percent, from about 13 percent today. </p>\n<p id=\"cAOgdk\">In the run-up to the vote, Tesla used both carrots and sticks to whip the vote. The company dangled an exclusive tour of the Austin factory led by Musk himself as a potential prize for select investors. It also issued an ominous warning that a failure to approve the pay package could spur Musk to abandon Tesla. </p>\n<p id=\"aAZ6WW\">The idea of Musk leaving his post at Tesla seems far less likely now that shareholders have confirmed his status as one of the most well-compensated person on the planet. But the saga of his pay package isn’t over yet. </p>"

The lawsuit was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-shareholders-elon-musk-lawsuit-ai-2024-6\">first reported by <em>Business Insider</em></a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/tesla-shareholders-sue-musk-for-starting-competing-ai-company/\">and <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. </p>\n<p id=\"Ct6upd\">The plaintiffs include the <a href=\"https://www.cbtfunds.com/\">Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund</a> as well as two individual shareholders, Daniel Hazen and Michael Giampietro, on behalf of Tesla itself.</p>\n<p id=\"DLD1gY\">They note that, for years, Musk has sought to position Tesla not as a car company but as a robotics and AI powerhouse. The claim helped propel Tesla’s stock price, resulting in the company’s value exceeding that of top automakers combined. </p>\n<p id=\"jKq09S\">All the while, Musk was “diverting scarce talent and resources from Tesla to xAI, and raised billons of dollars for xAI while touting xAI’s access to Tesla’s AI-related data,” the lawsuit reads. Last week, xAI raised $6 billion in its initial funding round, which it said it will use to bring its first products to market. So far, xAI has launched Grok, a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23992489/xai-musk-grok-humor-chatbot\">supposedly edgier</a> version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is available via X but only for Premium subscribers.</p>\n<div id=\"7nsKIe\">\n<p style=\" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\">   <a title=\"View 2024 06 13 e Filed Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint Tesla Xai on Scribd\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F742035337%2F2024-06-13-e-Filed-Verified-Stockholder-Derivative-Complaint-Tesla-Xai%23from_embed&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F6%2F13%2F24177975%2Ftesla-shareholder-lawsuit-elon-musk-xai-rival-compete\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 06 13 e Filed Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint Tesla Xai</a> by <a title=\"View ahawkins8223's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fuser%2F112638498%2Fahawkins8223%23from_embed&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F6%2F13%2F24177975%2Ftesla-shareholder-lawsuit-elon-musk-xai-rival-compete\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ahawkins8223</a> on Scribd</p>\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"2024 06 13 e Filed Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint Tesla Xai\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/742035337/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-zoq5E0WMZ4RUYViqxBg3\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_48945\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p id=\"4ackNO\">The plaintiffs also cite <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html\">a recent CNBC<em> </em>report</a> about Musk ordering thousands of Nvidia-made AI chips destined for Tesla to be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171165/elon-musk-tesla-x-nvidia-ai-chips-divert\">diverted to the social media company</a>.

Former White House photographer Pete Souza pointed out the tag popping up on an upload of a photo originally taken on film during a basketball game 40 years ago, speculating that using Adobe’s cropping tool and flattening images might have triggered it.</p>\n<p id=\"bPCbQx\">“As we’ve said from the beginning, we’re consistently improving our AI products, and we are working closely with our industry partners on our approach to AI labeling,” said Meta spokesperson Kate McLaughlin. The new label is supposed to more accurately represent that the content may simply be modified rather than making it seem like it is entirely AI-generated.</p>\n<p id=\"ZkWcaL\">The problem seems to be the metadata tools like Adobe Photoshop apply to images and how platforms interpret that. After Meta <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24121978/meta-ai-generated-content-label-requirements-deepfakes\">expanded its policies around labeling AI content</a>, real-life pictures posted to platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Threads were tagged “Made with AI.” </p>\n<p id=\"R1eSdS\">However, Adobe points the finger at Meta and its decisions about how to present that metadata. “We know millions of users use AI today to perform the same aesthetic improvements to content as they did before AI. That’s why when it comes to labeling AI, we believe platforms labeling content as being made with or generated by AI should only do so when an image is wholly AI generated,” said Andy Parsons, Adobe senior director of the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), in a statement emailed to <em>The Verge</em>. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Screenshot of Facebook’s mobile app with a picture of a cat that has the “AI Info” tag applied to it.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9vTO0c2kxTDpAmASTfW6nNip2x8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25513824/01_FB_AI_Generated_Content_Lable_Carousel_02_1_1.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Meta</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"z74Zdd\">You may see the new labeling first on mobile apps and then the web view later, as McLaughlin tells<em> The Verge</em> it is starting to roll out across all surfaces. </p>\n<p id=\"hBIPl3\">Once you click the tag, it will still show the same message as the old label, which has a more detailed explanation of why it might have been applied and that it could cover images fully generated by AI or edited with tools that include AI tech, like Generative Fill. Metadata tagging tech like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911381/adobe-ai-generated-content-symbol-watermark\">C2PA</a> was supposed to make telling the difference between AI-generated and real images simpler and easier, but that future isn’t here yet.</p>\n<p id=\"1IRYsB\"><strong>Andy Parsons, Adobe:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"68semM\">Content Credentials are an open technical standard designed to provide important information like a “nutrition label” for digital content such as the creator’s name, the date an image was created, what tools were used and any edits that were made, including if generative AI was used. At Adobe we are excited by the promise and potential of the integration of AI into creative workflows to transform how people imagine, ideate, and create. In a world where anything digital can be edited, we recognize how important it is for Content Credentials to carry the context to make clear how content was created and edited, including if the content was wholly generated by a generative AI model. The Content Credentials standard was designed from the ground up to clearly express this context.</p>\n<p id=\"2U3OwA\">Through our role leading the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and co-founding the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, we understand how to best express how content has been edited is an evolving process. We know millions of users use AI today to perform the same aesthetic improvements to content as they did before AI. That’s why when it comes to labeling AI, we believe platforms labeling content as being made with or generated by AI should only do so when an image is wholly AI generated. That way, people will easily understand that the content they are viewing is entirely fake. If generative AI is only used in the editing process, the full context of Content Credentials should be viewable to provide deeper context into the authenticity, edits or underlying facts the creator may want to communicate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"GKTgp0\"><em><strong>Update, July 2nd: </strong></em><em>Added statement from Adobe.</em></p>"

The European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3582\">writes in a preliminary ruling</a> that the “pay or consent” advertising model that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955987/instagram-facebook-without-ads-eu-subscription\">launched last year for Facebook and Instagram users</a> runs afoul of Article 5(2) of the DMA by not giving users a third option that uses less data for ad targeting but is still free to use.</p>\n<p id=\"18zwXE\">Regulators found in their investigation that Meta gives users a “binary choice” that forces them to either choose to pay a monthly subscription fee to get the ad-free version of Facebook and Instagram or consent to the ad-supported version. Where Meta runs afoul of its rules, it says, is by not letting users opt for a free version that “uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the ‘personalised ads’ based service” and by not allowing them to “exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"EZpolB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How the EU’s DMA is changing Big Tech: all of the news and updates\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24040543/eu-dma-digital-markets-act-big-tech-antitrust\"},{\"title\":\"Facebook and Instagram launch a paid ad-free subscription\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938283/facebook-instagram-ad-free-subscription-eu\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"XR037e\">“Our preliminary view is that Meta’s advertising model fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act,” wrote Margrethe Vestager, who leads the region’s competition policy. “And we want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalised ads experience.”</p>\n<p id=\"RNyjRD\">The commission explains the part of the DMA it believes Meta has violated:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"ht9PEI\">Under Article 5(2) of the DMA, gatekeepers must seek users’ consent for combining their personal data between designated core platform services and other services, and if a user refuses such consent, they should have access to a less personalised but equivalent alternative. Gatekeepers cannot make use of the service or certain functionalities conditional on users’ consent.</p></blockquote>\n<div id=\"zXqHcT\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" align=\"center\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DMA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DMA</a> is here to give back    users the power to decide over their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/data?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#data</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Meta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Meta</a> has forced millions of users across EU into a binary choice : “pay or consent”.<br><br>In our preliminary conclusion this is a breach of the DMA.<br><br>Today we take an important step to ensure Meta complies. <a href=\"https://t.co/lGXagHuq7J\">pic.twitter.com/lGXagHuq7J</a></p>— Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1807715743129043342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 1, 2024</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n</div>\n<p id=\"5WHQcp\">“Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,” Meta spokesperson Matthew Pollard told <em>The Verge</em> in an email. “We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.”</p>\n<p id=\"IAafxZ\">The commission says that it has informed Meta of its charges and has the opportunity to respond to its findings. If Meta is ultimately found to be in violation when the investigation concludes next year, the EU could fine it as much as 10 percent of its total worldwide revenue, which, for Meta, could be as much as $13.4 billion <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058645/metas-business-is-booming-and-so-is-threads\">based on its results for 2023</a>. The penalty could grow to up to 20 percent if the company is found to continue violating the DMA.</p>\n<p id=\"IBtm4l\">Meta is the second company charged since the DMA went into full force in March 2024. The commission asserted last week that Apple’s App Store “steering” policies <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184629/apple-dma-steering-infringement-ruling\">don’t allow sufficient competition</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"WkBh0o\"></p>\n<p id=\"jYglJf\"></p>\n<p id=\"rtEc94\"></p>"

Meta previously <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/13/23351094/facebook-community-chats-launch-messenger-groups\">introduced that feature in 2022</a>, allowing Facebook group admins to create Discord-like chatrooms for members. This new type of chat, meanwhile, is open to anyone — users could make one for their neighborhood, school, or an event, for example.</p>\n<p id=\"URDBlC\">Meta <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/685507703461811?ref=ipl&amp;_rdr\">notes</a> that creating Messenger “Communities” isn’t yet available to everyone and that users should be aware there’s a different level of privacy that they typically associate with personal messages.</p>\n<p id=\"GQneac\">The gradual updates to Messenger bring it more in line with platforms like WhatsApp or Discord. In 2022, WhatsApp’s messaging capabilities <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23024703/whatsapp-communities-admin-group-messaging-feature\">also expanded</a>, letting admins of groups communicate with thousands of people at once instead of the more private, direct conversations the platform was known for. </p>\n<p id=\"jpwoEQ\">Messaging has become a key focus for other Meta platforms like Instagram, too. Instagram head Adam Mosseri has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagrams-adam-mosseri-spills-on-podcast-threads-creator-monetization-dms-2023-8\">said</a> that DMs account for much of the platform’s growth and that young people especially spend a lot of time messaging. Last year, Instagram rolled out the ability to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23602833/meta-instagram-channels-telegram-facebook-messenger\">send mass updates via DMs</a> — called “channels” — in a feature similar to Telegram. Creators can run their own channel for followers and send updates, announcements, and more. The company has also tried to make DMs more interactive <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/30/24116702/instagram-is-working-on-in-channel-photo-contests\">with things like contests run through messages</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"OnGyN5\"></p>\n<p id=\"hHcfmZ\"></p>\n<p id=\"1m8QbL\"></p>\n<p id=\"QV9Ix7\"></p>"

Given how wild Facebook comment sections often become, it’s not hard to imagine how ridiculous some of these summaries turn out. (This isn’t the first time Meta’s AI has appeared in the comment section, by the way: <em>404 Media</em> spotted it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133184/metas-ai-apparently-thinks-it-has-a-child\">pretending to be a parent</a> in a Facebook group.)</p>\n<p id=\"2CjGEY\">After seeing screenshots of the feature shared on <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@travelinganna/post/C7ob3xmsmpT?xmt=AQGzr3-Jt1zRn67Vx-yVQtsXiWbxw_KstQUVMiTx3BBCQ74\">Threads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1cqifvm/instead_of_showing_me_the_comments_on_my/\">Reddit</a>, I decided to check the comment sections on my Facebook app. I found the AI summaries popping up on many of the posts I checked — unhinged responses and all. One AI summary on a post about a store closure said, “Some commenters attribute the closure to the store ‘going woke’ or having poor selection, while others point to the rise of online shopping.” </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9kAQJcwx_NBtHoPx2LXMRi9Ddkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25472622/meta_ai_summary_facebook.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: The Verge</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"SnwbCA\">Another Facebook post from <em>Vice</em> about Mexican street wrestlers prompted a comment section summary that said some people were “less impressed” with the performance and referred to it as a “moronic way of panhandling.” The AI also picked up some of the more lighthearted jokes people made about a bobcat sighting in a Florida town. “Some admired the sighting, with one commenter hoping the bobcat remembered sunscreen.”</p>\n<p id=\"7yIeaO\">It’s still not clear how Meta chooses which posts to display comment summaries on, and the company didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p>\n<p id=\"7zHd5C\">Either way, the summaries really don’t include anything that I found useful (unless you love vague notions about what random people have to say) — but it could help you identify posts where the comment section has gotten too toxic to bother scrolling. </p>\n<p id=\"5Eol7o\">The AI summaries have also prompted privacy concerns, as Meta is feeding user comments into its AI system to generate them. Over the past week or so, many Facebook and Instagram users in the European Union and the UK received a notification informing them that Meta will train its AI on their content. (Data protection laws in both regions require Meta to disclose this information.) Although Meta will let these users object to having their data used to train AI, the <a href=\"https://x.com/Tantacrul/status/1794863603964891567\">process isn’t that simple</a>, and the company has <a href=\"https://x.com/merryfight/status/1795541234586702016\">rejected some users’</a> requests.</p>\n<p id=\"XMCfaB\">Here in the US, Meta’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai/\">privacy policy page</a> says the company uses “information shared on Meta’s Products and services” to train AI, including posts, photos, and captions. Meta lets you submit a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24063327/ai-art-protect-images-copyright-generators\">request to correct or delete personal information</a> used to train its AI models, but it only applies to information from a third party. Everything else seems to be fair game.</p>"

Missouri</em></a><em> </em>— it would be. </p>\n<p id=\"uboO50\">Internal communications at Meta (then Facebook), Google, and Amazon from 2021, cited in the report, show serious pressure from the Biden administration pushing the platforms to do more to combat covid and vaccine misinformation. But the documents also show executives who at times seemed unwilling to cave to pressure, at other points convinced by certain arguments, and sometimes angered and off-put by the administration’s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"t1VLTl\">Newly released private conversations among Meta’s top executives, for example, give a new glimpse into how the company navigated a tense relationship with the Biden administration in the early days of the campaign to vaccinate Americans against covid-19, particularly after President Joe Biden himself accused the company of “killing people.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"AjYVHR\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Mark Zuckerberg isn’t being held in contempt of Congress after all\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23809960/facebook-meta-mark-zuckerbeg-contempt-jordan-white-house\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"QWI9lG\">The report comes after House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/15/jim-jordan-subpoenas-alphabet-amazon-apple-meta-and-microsoft-.html\">subpoenaed Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft</a> last year for their communications with the federal government, saying at the time he wished to “understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.” Jordan also chairs a subcommittee established for this purpose — the House Judiciary Committee’s Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government — and nearly hosted a vote to hold Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in contempt of Congress for failing to produce documents. He ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23809960/facebook-meta-mark-zuckerbeg-contempt-jordan-white-house\">called it off</a>, saying the company had begun to cooperate more.</p>\n<p id=\"IWSZUH\">Amazon, Google, and Meta declined to give comment for this article. <em>The Verge</em> also reached out to the White House and Democratic Judiciary Committee staff for comment on the report but did not receive a response in time for publication.</p>\n<p id=\"IDlEF4\">On Wednesday, the select subcommittee <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-weaponization-federal-government-7\">held a hearing</a> with two of the former Biden administration officials referenced in the documents: Andy Slavitt and Rob Flaherty. In their prepared statements, they both emphasize that their communication with social media companies was meant to understand how they were implementing their own policies around misinformation. Slavitt, the former senior advisor to the Biden covid response team, <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Slavitt%20Testimony.pdf\">said the administration’s interactions with tech companies</a> were “entirely consistent” with the First Amendment. He added that “we had no intention of coercing social media companies into taking any action. And I never received any indication that our dialogue was ever interpreted that way.”</p>\n<p id=\"c1Zlux\">“Urging media to publish accurate information is nothing new for communications staffers,” <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Flaherty%20Testimony.pdf\">said Flaherty</a>, who served in the Biden administration as director of the White House’s Office of Digital Strategy. “To be clear, these companies are the ultimate decision makers about what goes on their platforms. But that does not mean that the White House, through its communications office, cannot ask — even implore — media companies to address misinformation on their platforms.” He went on to add that legislators, companies, advocacy groups, and others “likewise try to persuade media to see things their way.”</p>\n<p id=\"WfL8OR\">The committee’s report highlights instances that it characterizes as pressure or coercion from the Biden administration to censor speech on platforms such as Facebook, Google’s YouTube, and Amazon. While Jordan had initially set out to show <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/media/in-the-news/jordan-demands-big-tech-records-detailing-collusion-with-biden-admin-to-censor\">“collusion” between big tech platforms and the administration</a> to censor conservatives, the published report has leaned away from the word “collusion” in favor of the word “coercion.” (“Collusion” appears just once in the 90-page report.)</p>\n<p id=\"W5dEqa\">This matters because a Supreme Court case about the Biden administration’s alleged <em>coercion</em> of social media platforms into certain kinds of content moderation decisions is pending a decision right now. <em>Murthy v. Missouri</em> is all about where to draw the line between (entirely legal) persuasion from the government versus (illegal) coercion. The shift in language means the Jordan report becomes more aligned with the core arguments in that case. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"dopL26\"><q>A “last ditch effort to influence the Supreme Court opinion in the case of <em>Murthy v. Missouri</em>”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"6RbzzM\">At Wednesday’s hearing, Select Subcommittee Ranking Member Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands, accused Republicans of holding the hearing now as a “last ditch effort to influence the Supreme Court opinion in the case of <em>Murthy v. Missouri.</em>” </p>\n<p id=\"jwEh8C\">Plaskett said committee staff gathered “hundreds of hours of testimony” showing social media companies saying they “evaluated the content against their own internal policies” and “only took action if the content violated those policies.”</p>\n<p id=\"jvygz8\">But Republicans, Plaskett said, have repeatedly declined to make the testimony public and declined to give Democrats “hundreds of hours of video taken during those investigations.” Plaskett asked to enter several transcripts of interviews with tech executives into the record, but there was an objection. Jordan said that they “plan to release all of these once we’ve talked to everyone we’ve interviewed and their counsel to make sure that they’re comfortable with it.”</p>\n<p id=\"dpSahH\">What did get released is an intriguing glimpse into how social media policy gets made. But still — is any of this coercion? In one WhatsApp exchange, as apoplectic Meta executives seethe over a Biden comment throwing them under the bus, they fling around phrases like “engage with them” or “engage in good faith” or “our working relationship” when describing their ties to the government — remarkably anodyne characterizations despite the otherwise high emotion in the chat.</p>\n<p id=\"6Hk4ST\">Ultimately, this question — whether any of the pressure from the White House was coercion — is something the Supreme Court will be answering in the coming months. </p>\n<h2 id=\"4aVnW1\">A ‘knife fight’ after Biden’s Facebook comment</h2>\n<p id=\"0XfcgH\">The committee’s report reveals previously private communications between top executives at Meta, including one that shows how they navigated its most pointed and public critique from the country’s leader. </p>\n<p id=\"bZlPDI\">A July 2021 WhatsApp exchange reveals how Meta’s top executives reacted to President Joe Biden’s statement that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms\">Facebook is “killing people”</a> based on its handling of misinformation around covid. He later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583809/joe-biden-facebook-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-killing-people\">walked back the remark</a>, saying that “Facebook isn’t killing people; these 12 people are out there giving misinformation,” pointing to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines\">an administration report</a> on vaccine misinformation. “That’s what I meant.”</p>\n<p id=\"vv18bt\">Before Biden’s walk-back, however, Facebook executives were incensed by the comment. In WhatsApp messages the day of Biden’s initial remark, then-COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote, “Ugh on Biden today.” Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg responded, “The behavior of the WH over the last 24 hours has been highly cynical and dishonest.” </p>\n<p id=\"8XHF9m\">Sandberg told Clegg she wanted Facebook’s response to be “as aggressive as you can live with,” suggesting an on-the-record statement and messaging that Biden was using Facebook as a scapegoat. Clegg said, “[We’re] doing all those things and more — it’s a knife fight.”</p>\n<p id=\"PRj2GH\">Zuckerberg chimed in, asking, “Can we include that the WH put pressure on us to censor the lab leak theory?” But Clegg threw cold water on that, saying, “I don’t think they put specific pressure on that theory — it was always ‘do more’ generic pressure.” </p>\n<p id=\"AUCWGx\">Joel Kaplan, a public policy executive at the time, presciently warned against suggesting Facebook censored the lab leak theory at the White House’s behest because it would “supercharge” conservative critiques that it’s “collaborating” with the Biden administration “to censor speech.” (Kaplan previously served under the George W. Bush administration. While employed as a Facebook executive, he sat behind <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/technology/facebook-kavanaugh-nomination-kaplan.html\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> in putative support during the Congressional hearing over the Supreme Court nominee’s alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford.) </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"sdtMAX\"><q>“If they’re more interested in criticizing us than actually solving the problems, then I’m not sure how it’s helping the cause to engage with them further,” Zuckerberg wrote</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"M2RdpR\">Sandberg and Zuckerberg both referred to the Biden administration as “scapegoating” Facebook to cover “their own missed vaccination rates,” as Sandberg put it. That language <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/facebook-hit-back-biden-saying-050632669.html\">appeared in coverage</a> following Biden’s remark.</p>\n<p id=\"vHZWdB\">The exchange also appears to show that, rather than feeling beholden to Biden’s will, the incident actually pushed Facebook’s top executives to want to engage less with the federal government. “If they’re more interested in criticizing us than actually solving the problems, then I’m not sure how it’s helping the cause to engage with them further,” Zuckerberg wrote. </p>\n<p id=\"jkCRPd\">Clegg said he agreed that “if this is the way they want to play it we have little incentive to engage in good faith with them.”</p>\n<p id=\"ZqwvXR\">“We definitely need to reset our working relationship with them,” Zuckerberg said.</p>\n<p id=\"Obv6HZ\">Sandberg added, “And another thought. Did Trump say things this irresponsible? If Trump blamed a private company not himself and his govt, everyone would have gone nuts.” </p>\n<p id=\"dhqMIT\">In 2018, CNN ran an article titled “<a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/04/news/companies/trump-companies-attacks/index.html\">Amazon and 16 other companies Trump has attacked since his election</a>.” Facebook is included.</p>\n<h2 id=\"oeCDJm\">Fact-checking the lab leak theory</h2>\n<p id=\"V8Xh6G\">Another exchange among top executives at Meta sheds light on how the company navigated changing opinions among the third-party fact-checkers that it relied on to inform its policies during the pandemic. The lab leak hypothesis — the theory that the covid-19 virus originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China — was, according to scientific consensus at the start of the pandemic, a wild conspiracy theory. Over time, the lab leak theory — while still a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/virologists-and-epidemiologists-back-natural-origin-covid-19-survey-suggests\">minority opinion</a> in the scientific community — is <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html\">no longer stigmatized</a> as pure fabrication.  </p>\n<p id=\"EeVzFP\">In June 2021, a trust and safety executive explained in an email to Zuckerberg that some of the third-party fact-checkers they relied on either rescinded their false rating or acknowledged uncertainty about the lab leak theory. The executive says that the company had removed posts including any of five claims rated as false by its fact-check network in February 2021, including that the disease was man-made or engineered by a government or country. That decision, at the time, came “in response to continued public pressure and tense conversations with the new Administration,” which, based on the timing, would have been the Biden administration. </p>\n<p id=\"5qHQMi\">But, the trust and safety executive added, Zuckerberg had also asked the team back in February to review the decision further into the year “to determine if we should revert to reduce &amp; inform” rather than remove the posts.</p>\n<p id=\"zg2hOJ\">Zuckerberg wrote that the new development “seems like a good reminder that when we compromise our standards due to pressure from an administration in either direction, we’ll often regret it later.”</p>\n<p id=\"d5hKIM\">Conservatives will no doubt zero in on the phrase “compromise our standards due to pressure from an administration” — that part seems to imply that Meta was pressured initially into flagging the lab leak hypothesis as misinformation — but the following clause, “we’ll often regret it later,” may be just as indicative of how Meta relates to the government. Buyer’s remorse is only possible when you’re free to make (or not make) a purchase.   </p>\n<h2 id=\"c4xRCH\">From collusion to coercion</h2>\n<p id=\"w7Sutl\">The committee says it’s reviewed “tens of thousands of emails and other relevant nonpublic documents” that it says show that the “Biden White House coerced companies to suppress free speech.”</p>\n<p id=\"sGvzPR\">That framing is significant since it’s also the focus of a major Supreme Court case expected to be decided by the end of June that will have major ramifications on the federal government’s ability to communicate with social media firms.</p>\n<p id=\"W31lDA\">The committee’s report focuses more on the coercion element rather than collusion — again, a word only used once in the document. That makes the legal questions around the Biden administration’s engagement with social media companies very similar to those debated before the Supreme Court earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101298/supreme-court-murthy-missouri-speech-social-media\">in <em>Murthy v. Missouri</em></a>. The central issue in <em>Murthy</em> is whether the Biden administration violated the First Amendment by coercing social media companies — namely, by flagging posts that the government itself deemed as harmful (e.g., medical or election misinformation) and exerting pressure to remove them. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"x8AJ3P\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"SCOTUS to hear case on how the government talks to social media companies\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101298/supreme-court-murthy-missouri-speech-social-media\"},{\"title\":\"The Supreme Court is skeptical of restricting the White House from talking to social media platforms\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104892/justices-limiting-government-social-media-communication-murthy-v-missouri\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"AtB8uW\">A key consideration in that case is whether this government engagement amounted to unconstitutional coercion of speech (known as jawboning) or permissible persuasion. In oral arguments, justices on both sides of the political spectrum <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104892/justices-limiting-government-social-media-communication-murthy-v-missouri\">seemed worried about placing broad limits</a> on how tech companies could communicate with the government and questioned the cause-and-effect link the Republican states drew to the Biden administration’s pressure and platforms’ content moderation policy decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"Z5cBNh\">The documents in the report may raise the same causal questions for some: did platforms feel coerced to change their policies, or were they ultimately persuaded by the arguments they heard from the government? Documents from Amazon and YouTube also show that the companies seemed to feel pressure from Biden administration officials about their covid content moderation choices but also, at points, deflected their suggestions or made changes to their policies months after the administration engaged them. </p>\n<p id=\"8jd6xI\">YouTube, for example, shared a new proposed policy around vaccine safety content in September 2021, according to the report, after months of engagement with the administration. Back in July of that year, YouTube’s public policy team did not commit to a Biden administration official to any new policies and responded to a question about what it calls “borderline content” with stats about the low reach that content already receives. On September 21st, a member of the YouTube policy team asked White House official Rob Flaherty about dates to preview and seek feedback on its “new policy to remove content that could mislead people on the safety and efficacy of vaccines.” On September 29th, after the policy was released, Flaherty apologizes for failing to respond to the previous message but says he “saw the news” and that “at first blush, seems like a great step.”</p>\n<p id=\"tyf8qk\">During <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104892/justices-limiting-government-social-media-communication-murthy-v-missouri\">arguments in <em>Murthy v. Missouri</em></a>, Justice Elena Kagan was skeptical of a monthslong gap between the Biden administration asking Facebook not to distribute a post about vaccine hesitancy and the platform allegedly blocking a health group as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"i7tsuz\">“A lot of things could happen in two months,” Kagan said.</p>\n<p class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"eiN7HC\">We know Jordan — who chairs the committee and subcommittee that released this report — is invested in the outcome of the Supreme Court case because he actually attended the oral arguments. An opinion is expected by the end of June. Meanwhile, House Republicans are not waiting for the Supreme Court — they say in the report they are working on new legislation, like the <a href=\"https://www.schmitt.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-schmitt-introduces-the-censorship-accountability-act/#:~:text=The%20Censorship%20Accountability%20Act%20is,engaged%20in%20censorship%20for%20damages.\">Censorship Accountability Act,</a> which would let individuals sue executive branch officials for damages for censoring their speech.</p>"

The probe comes amid <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/european-powers-warn-spike-russian-propaganda-before-eu-elections-2024-02-12/\">a spike in online pro-Russian propaganda</a> in the run-up to EU elections in early June.</p>\n<p id=\"5qBejQ\">In a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2373\">press release on Tuesday</a>, the European Commission claims that Meta may have breached its obligations under the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23845672/eu-digital-services-act-explained\">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a>, a set of EU rules that aim to protect users by fostering safer online environments. The potential violations being investigated cover Meta’s approach to tackling disinformation campaigns and “coordinated inauthentic behavior” in the EU, alongside the lack of effective third-party tools for monitoring elections and civic discourse in real time — with particular concern that Meta is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100678/meta-kills-crowdtangle\">deprecating CrowdTangle</a> without an adequate replacement.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"fZPXbh\"><q>The EU has called its leaders to urgently counter Russian interference ahead of elections in June</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"2jDTZu\">The concerns about election monitoring follow a <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240419IPR20542/meps-call-for-a-firm-response-to-counter-russian-interference\">call for EU political leaders</a> to “urgently and vigorously” counter Russia’s attempts to interfere with democratic processes across the bloc. According to France’s European affairs minister Jean-Noel Barrot, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-29/france-says-almost-all-eu-states-target-of-russian-propaganda\">almost every EU country is being targeted</a> by Russian propaganda ahead of European elections starting on June 6th.</p>\n<p id=\"9EVSRP\">Alongside the announcement of the investigation, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"0c2VVR\">This Commission has created means to protect European citizens from targeted disinformation and manipulation by third countries. If we suspect a violation of the rules, we act. This is true at all times, but especially in times of democratic elections. Big digital platforms must live up to their obligations to put enough resources into this and today’s decision shows that we are serious about compliance. Protecting our democracies is a common fight with our Member States.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"vnATXl\">The probe will also assess how Meta moderates deceptive advertising, policies that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24111604/meta-setting-downranks-politics-instagram-threads\">reduce the visibility of political content</a> on Instagram and Facebook, and the sufficiency of mechanisms that allow users to flag illegal content.</p>\n<p id=\"MihT1M\">“If we cannot be sure that we can trust content that we see online there’s a risk that we end up not believing anything at all,” said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager. “Deceptive advertising is a risk to our online debate and ultimately to our rights as both consumers and citizens.”</p>\n<p id=\"Xef7bg\">The European Commission hasn’t given itself a deadline for the investigation. If Meta is found to be in violation of the DSA and fails to remedy the issues, it could face fines of up to 6 percent of its annual turnover.</p>"

It was a lovely day. The new foliage was just coming out and flocks of migrating birds were flying overhead — just the right day for a bunch of photos and good memories.</p>\n<p id=\"O1ALaG\">Unfortunately, my reason for traveling upstate wasn’t for the flora and fauna, but to attend the funeral of my best friend. I took lots of photos on that day: of other friends who attended the service, of the river paths and local parks that my best friend and I used to walk together, and of the home she used to share with her parents, now empty. I took all of those photos because I knew it was probably the last time that I would visit that place. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"nUktRO\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"It’s time for a hard reset on notifications\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24119076/ios-android-notifications-focus-modes-scheduled-summary\"},{\"title\":\"When notifications remind us of things we’d rather forget\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24147418/intrusive-notifications-bad-memories-cloud-storage\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"BXMA5u\">And one year later, predictably, Google popped up in my notifications with an invitation to revisit the “wonderful” memories of that day. It was not something I needed — or wanted — a reminder of, especially a peppy reminder that assumed I had a wonderful time and wanted to share all those exhilarating memories with all my friends.</p>\n<p id=\"AUqTYa\">I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who finds these pop-ups less of a joy and more of an emotional arrow headed into your heart. </p>\n<p id=\"AdhB94\">Of course, you can avoid these notifications by just pulling out of the internet or muting all of your notifications — but if you’ve got friends you want to keep in touch with or notifications that are important to you, that won’t work. In addition, you may <em>like</em> having some of these memory reminders appear — just not all of them. What if, say, you want to simply avoid photos of an ex or of the trip where you made a total fool of yourself? </p>\n<p id=\"tEX7Dj\">Perhaps <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karolinawaclawiak/life-events-google-memories-facebook-grief\">because of</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-beautiful-collage-of-exes-when-your-phones-photo-memories-hit-a-raw-nerve-c7d41838?st=qqqwt0lfplfijyy&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\">all the</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem\">complaints</a>, some of the more egregious offenders — Google Photos, Apple Photos, Facebook, and Microsoft OneDrive — have ways that you can stop them from appearing. Depending on the app, you can tweak your settings to avoid specific memory notifications — or stop them altogether. </p>\n<p id=\"o1CUQH\">Here is how to rein in unwanted memories from these four apps. </p>\n<h2 id=\"6NN7rd\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/photos/about/\">Google Photos</a></h2>\n<p id=\"OrdyEg\">You can tweak the Memories feature in Google Photos to stop specific groups of photos or bring it to a total halt.

An aluminum edition is coming out this month, and the company says that the new handhelds “areprecision CNC’d entirely in aluminum.” They come in four colors — natural, noir, black, and indigo — and will be <a href=\"https://store.analogue.co/\">available to preorder</a> on July 15th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, with units expected to ship on July 17th.</p>\n<p id=\"lO4Yiv\">That metal body doesn’t come cheap, though. The aluminum Pocket will cost $499, a big boost over the $219 of the standard version. Analogue says that the new version will be “available in highly limited quantities and will never be sold again.”</p>\n<p id=\"RuTgr2\">Here’s a look at all the aluminum parts of the device:</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A photo of Analogue Pocket parts made from aluminum.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WieQd-xPoWICSrb85cK4xKoIOfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25528089/2_AP_Aluminum_LE___parts.png\">\n      <cite>Image: Analogue</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"dNMETL\">Since its launch in 2021, Analogue has released a handful of other special editions of the Pocket, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23961099/analogue-pocket-special-edition-classic-colors-gameboy-advance\">some bright colors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848739/analogue-pocket-glow-in-the-dark-preorders\">a glow-in-the-dark version</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23888931/analogue-pocket-transparent-price-release-date\">the always-popular transparent shell</a>. The device allows gamers to play old Game Boy cartridges (as well as other carts, with the right adapters) on a handheld with modern touches like a crisp LCD screen.</p>\n<p id=\"8SeOsq\">The Pocket was the company’s first handheld device after previously releasing high-quality recreations of consoles like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review\">NES</a> (which also came in aluminum), <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review\">SNES</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date\">Sega Genesis</a>. Up next is the Nintendo 64 with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64\">the Analogue 3D</a>, which was originally planned for a 2024 release.</p>"

Rabbit is now <a href=\"https://x.com/rabbit_hmi/status/1811490675093123263\">addressing the issue with a software update</a> that includes a new Factory Reset option in settings to wipe the device. Previously, you could only <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbitr1/comments/1cow69l/factory_reset/\">unlink your account</a> from an R1, which did not erase all user data.</p>\n<p id=\"nAt03H\">Along with the new ability to fully delete local user data, the software update also addresses another eyebrow-raising behavior of the R1. Prior to the update, stored pairing data that lets the R1 hardware add things to the Rabbithole journal also had permission to read the journal as well. That means a stolen and hacked R1 could potentially have handed over users’ saved requests, photos, and more.</p>\n<p id=\"sNrMf8\">With the update, R1’s pairing data can no longer read the journal and is no longer logged to the device, and Rabbit has reduced the amount of log data stored on the device. The company says there’s “no indication that pairing data has been abused to retrieve rabbithole journal data belonging to a former device owner.”</p>\n<p id=\"HzdyJT\">Rabbit’s security bulletin paints the issue as a relatively inconsequential risk with its example that a stolen and jailbroken R1 could reveal to a bad actor the last weather log asked by the original owner. Security researchers last month found that a jailbreak of the device could also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186614/rabbit-r1-security-flaw-api-key-codebase\">hand out hardcoded API keys</a>. The company promises to improve security practices and “prevent similar issues in the future,” saying it’s performing a full review of device logging practices to ensure it aligns with its standards “set in other areas.”</p>"

It’s easy, after several years, to be content with a desk that’s not quite right, a chair that’s not quite comfortable, or cables that have spread all over the floor. But when a move forces you to reorganize that space, it’s a chance to make a better place for yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"Dv2296\">We asked the staff of <em>The Verge</em> what they did when they were either moving into a new workspace or making over their old one. Here are some of their answers; we hope that one or two will be useful for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"LNuSyn\"><strong>Cable management</strong></h2>\n<h2 id=\"wFE8sq\">Clear cord clips</h2>\n<p id=\"MzgrwD\"><em>Emilia David, reporter</em></p>\n<div id=\"HIDG3R\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12359093\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"XhhljZ\">I suffer from a disease common in New York City called “not enough outlets in convenient spots,” so I have to stretch wires and extension cords in risky areas around my apartment. But while I haven’t quite figured out how to fix the mess of wires underneath my desk, all the extension cords and other wires I use around my home are nicely tucked away thanks to these <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09MRJMQML/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clear cord clips</a> I found on Amazon. </p>\n<p id=\"3nQeQX\">The clips come with an adhesive you can stick to the wall and a hook that holds the wire in place. I have them in two different widths: one that holds wires up to 0.3 inches in diameter and a thick boi for wider cords. And they’re clear, so they manage to blend into my walls. I used the clips to tuck my microwave cord against the backsplash molding, so it’s away from water. They’re also holding the extension cord for my toaster / air fryer on the baseboard to avoid it becoming a tripping hazard. I haven’t used the clips for the wires under my desk, but I’m sure I’ll find a way soon enough. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"XNOmC3\">\n<h2 id=\"81y7H4\">Magnetic cables</h2>\n<p id=\"KF7UDB\"><em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p>\n<div id=\"wonpPr\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360107\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"FbPeru\">Why keep a drawer full of tangled cables when you can have perfectly coiled cords always within reach? Try a tangle-free magnetic USB cable <a href=\"https://supercallatech.com/\">like these SuperCalla ones</a> instead. I keep mine stuck to a metal filing cabinet right next to my desk, and while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23138894/usb-cable-tangle-free-magnetic-self-winding\">many manufacturers cheap out on this type of cord</a>, I’ve found the SuperCalla to have excellent magnet strength. I just wish the company had a six-foot USB-C to USB-C cable with 100W charging and 10Gbps data — only the three-foot one does that. I’m eager to try some of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032563/tangle-free-magnetic-usb-c-cables-just-got-a-facelift\">braided magnetic ones</a> soon, too. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"SrqTkb\">\n<h2 id=\"G3Yu83\">Cable organizing box </h2>\n<p id=\"1DWh0z\"><em>Kaitlin Hatton, senior audience manager</em></p>\n<div id=\"j005Cp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360116\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"RfdVOr\">Last year, I went on a journey to organize my desk in the most efficient way possible while still remaining stylish. I stumbled on a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BKW4S4XS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s01?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set of these organizers online</a> and gave them a shot. </p>\n<p id=\"ctFaKx\">I was surprised at how nice the products were given the price. I use one of the two included organizers for my various cords, SD cards, pens, and small notebooks. I also keep an extra phone charger and wall plug in there so I can just grab the whole case and toss it in my bag as I head out. I use the second organizer from the set to catch all of my stray office supplies, like rubber bands, paper clips, and even a small sewing kit. (The sewing kit is mostly there because I have no idea where else I would put it.) They’re not the best organizers I’ve ever used, and the compartments are small, but they get the job done.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"tO46io\">\n<h2 id=\"3oJfyf\">Moldable glue</h2>\n<p id=\"yL0a5d\"><em>Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p>\n<div id=\"Ys0Wsp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360127\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"eBU5Xt\">I’ve never been all that handy, although it isn’t for want of trying. However, even I can manage to create a useful cable management system using <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsugru.com%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F24181347%2Fcable-management-desks-home-office-pc-laptop\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sugru Mouldable Glue</a> (their spelling). This is sort of a Play-Doh for adults; it comes in several basic colors, which can be combined to make other colors. You open the packet, take out the Sugru, mold it into the shape you want, stick it to another surface (if you need to), and let it dry.</p>\n<p id=\"g01ozb\">I’ve used it to make hooks for my kitchen curtains and my headphones, to mend the handle of a faucet in the bathtub, and to repair the worn covering of a cable. But the coolest thing I did was create a series of indented attachments on the side of my old desk that would hold my various cables and keep them in order. (Sugru knows this is a major issue as well; it actually has a video showing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrNPMpXkeA4\">how to create cable holders</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"yWW4x6\">Do they look professional? Not really. But they work. And next time, I may use Sugru to mold something a little more imaginative, just for fun.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"wy0Ugy\">\n<h2 id=\"4efkzI\"><strong>Desks</strong></h2>\n<h2 id=\"9tVLZC\">A standing desk</h2>\n<p id=\"wm5nx4\"><em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p>\n<div id=\"XG6SXj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360138\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"cKgkDc\">I think of my Kostival standing desk as the final form of all the desks I’ve had over the years. I’ve always had a combo of a desk with built-in shelving and a separate monitor stand, but something was always slightly off. Either the monitor stand wasn’t tall enough or there wasn’t enough storage for all my knickknacks and stationery supplies. My previous desk was similar to this one but was way too narrow. I took moving as an opportunity to start fresh and get a standing desk. Now, I try to stand for at least two hours per day, mostly when I’m doing passive tasks like responding to emails.</p>\n<p id=\"KByHTP\">What I like about this desk is that I can tuck my keyboard away and still have a spot for my journals. The drawers on each side house 90 percent of my stationery supplies, and there’s enough space for me to plop my laptop on its stand. I went from having two bookshelves in my office to only needing one. </p>\n<p id=\"Qppl2j\">(By the way, while my specific desk is no longer available, you can find similar desks like the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/inbox-zero-height-adjustable-standing-desk-w006115867.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one in the product box above</a>.)</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"gs9rzo\">\n<h2 id=\"7BMIdN\">Standing desk extension</h2>\n<p id=\"tCNg1m\"><em>Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p>\n<div id=\"7CYfYm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360149\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"o4svrI\">When we moved to our current home, I realized that it would be a lot healthier for me to have a standing desk. However, at that point (and especially after spending for the move), I didn’t want to invest in one — they do tend to be a bit pricey). Eventually, though, I found a great substitute: the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099PFGWY7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vivo height-adjustable standing desk converter</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"eMTcLP\">It sits on a small table next to my desk (in a sort of “L” formation) and has a handle that lets me smoothly raise the surface to exactly the right height. Now, whenever I want to spend some time standing rather than sitting, I just shift my laptop over to the Vivo, adjust its height (if I need to), and work away. When I want to sit again? I just move my laptop back to my desk. I can even adjust the Vivo so that the laptop camera is a better height for video meetings.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"uqryH8\">\n<h2 id=\"SxtlSC\"><strong>Other strategies</strong></h2>\n<h2 id=\"CbnXhR\">Monitor arms</h2>\n<p id=\"sP0Dru\"><em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p>\n<div id=\"GKXobd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360154\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"atiZy4\">It’s hard to fit <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23037594/sean-hollister-desk-razer-synology-microsoft\">three monitors on a 48-inch desk</a> — unless you go all Doctor Octopus to keep ’em off the table. My articulating monitor arm of choice is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dell-MSA14-Single-Monitor-MH1HV/dp/B00C6CMZVC?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dell MSA14</a>, which I use to float a pair of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-24-Inch-LED-Lit-Monitor/dp/B005JN9310?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dell U2412M</a> monitors that I found off Craigslist for something like $50 each. (I use the pair as vertical monitors for websites and various messengers, not movies or games.) </p>\n<p id=\"sTjUrQ\">If you’re going with another brand of monitor, you’ll likely want a standard VESA mount instead. Just make sure the arm is rated for the weight of your monitor, don’t cheap out <em>too </em>much, and watch a video or something to make sure they articulate in all the ways you need.</p>\n<p id=\"WGdCP6\">Oh, and don’t forget to leave space on or around the desk for the arms to turn: I learned the hard way that putting my desk in a corner greatly restricted their freedom of movement. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"xnbIja\">\n<h2 id=\"RfMzGB\">USB switcher</h2>\n<p id=\"aQ3uhq\"><em>Antonio G. Di Benedetto, commerce writer </em></p>\n<div id=\"DaTFFs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360206\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"0fbZs6\">My secret weapon in bouncing back and forth between work and personal machines is a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CTLJ8V7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">USB switcher</a>. It’s basically just a small button beneath my monitor with some cables and dongles going in and out of it. I have four peripherals plugged into it: an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/insta360-Link-Noise-Canceling-Microphones-Specialized/dp/B0B826KS4B?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Insta360 Link webcam</a>, a fancy-schmancy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B07QR73T66?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</a> (fourth-gen) audio interface for the fancy-schmancy mic I have no business owning, a 2.4GHz USB dongle for whatever mechanical keyboard I’m currently using, and another USB wireless receiver for my mouse. </p>\n<p id=\"ieSHD1\">I press the button on the switcher, and all four devices swap from my laptop to my desktop and vice versa. I find it super handy for keeping work and play separate while using the same peripherals. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"KlpBsu\">\n<h2 id=\"iSoBYI\">Pegboard plus pegs from 3D printer</h2>\n<p id=\"fGZayg\"><em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p>\n<div id=\"8Pr80P\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360225\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"XJd7AL\">Pegboards aren’t just for garages.

I’ve got a headset hook, a AA and AAA battery dispenser, and custom mounts for my old Steam and Stadia controllers, my VR headset, and more. I might even start designing my own. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"oloPZA\">\n<h2 id=\"e9PWpN\">A file cart</h2>\n<p id=\"sRLoKN\"><em>Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor</em></p>\n<div id=\"cEpzmy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12360244\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"aNtVF8\">If you’re someone like me whose organizational strategy tends to devolve into “I’ll just put this in a pile and deal with it later” — and whose later never seems to arrive — I recommend an open filing system. Files are like piles but easier to label and sort through. I used to just have a couple of desktop file holders, but since my last move, I keep an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Felfa%2Fbest-selling-solutions%2Fdrawer-units%2Felfa-mesh-file-carts%2F123d%3FproductId%3D11021254&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F24181347%2Fcable-management-desks-home-office-pc-laptop\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elfa mesh filing cart</a> under my desk. It fits scads of hanging files for in-progress projects while keeping my desktop free, and it has a couple of pull-out mesh drawers for the stuff that would go into my desk drawers if I had any. And it has wheels. </p>\n<p id=\"utqjXX\"></p>\n<p id=\"bAFJqQ\"></p>"

Starting at $139.99, it’s cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon ebook reader, which I’ll dive into later — for many of the same features. Those include a large 300pi display and an adjustable warm white frontlight, which make for a clear and enjoyable reading experience. The latter also conveniently improves sleep by cutting down on blue light that interrupts melatonin production. </p>\n<p id=\"Dsxa7g\">That warm white frontlighting is an advantage over the cool white of the $99.99 base-model Kindle, and unlike the base Kindle, the Paperwhite has IPX8 water resistance. The $189.99 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NWJXKQJ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Signature Edition Paperwhite</a> also has an auto-adjusting frontlight and no lockscreen ads. It also has wireless charging, which is a rare feature to find in an e-reader.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"The Kindle Paperwhite in front of a stack of books.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0fjce_wbANWZJ2n0M3fgVfP3XY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954538/cgartenberg_211020_4819_0005.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The Kindle Paperwhite comes with an adjustable warm white frontlight.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"gFCh6a\">Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world, and it dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because Amazon makes it incredibly easy to buy and read its stuff. Its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon does.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"d32Ku7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best Kindle deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21539047/best-amazon-kindle-deals\"},{\"title\":\"Amazon is making it easier to browse your entire library of books\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999804/amazon-your-books-library-recommendations\"},{\"title\":\"Heck yeah, an E Ink phone that makes sense\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033537/heck-yeah-an-e-ink-phone-that-makes-sense\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"pH8Msd\">There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite has lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 extra to get rid of them. It’s also too big to hold comfortably with one hand. Perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite’s biggest flaw, though — which it shares with all Kindles aside from Fire tablets — is that it’s not easy to read books purchased outside of Amazon’s store. Kindle ebook formats are proprietary and only work on Kindle. Unlike Kobo and other ebook readers, Kindles don’t support EPUB files, an open file format used by pretty much everyone <em>except</em> Amazon. So, for example, if you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore (or Barnes &amp; Noble or Google Play Books or many other ebook stores), you can’t easily read those books on a Kindle without using a workaround. There <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23842102/kindle-amazon-import-files-epub\">are ways to convert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle\">transfer file formats</a> so you can read on the Kindle and vice versa, but it’ll take a couple of extra steps.</p>\n<p id=\"anSU3u\">However, if you don’t buy your books elsewhere or you don’t mind shopping from Amazon, you’ll be more than happy with the Kindle Paperwhite.</p>\n<h4 id=\"YXkzbE\">\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books\">Read our Kindle Paperwhite review</a>.</h4>\n<h2 id=\"4JJ8kh\">The best non-Amazon ebook reader</h2>\n<div id=\"Yii0cV\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12351003\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"layout\":\"full_layout\"}'></div></div>\n<p id=\"Y1ktEW\"><small><em><strong>Dimensions:</strong></em></small><small><em> 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / </em></small><small><em><strong>Weight:</strong></em></small><small><em> 199.5 grams / </em></small><small><em><strong>Screen area and resolution:</strong></em></small><small><em> 7-inch screen, 300ppi  (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / </em></small><small><em><strong>Storage:</strong></em></small><small><em> 32GB / </em></small><small><em><strong>Other features:</strong></em></small><small><em> Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support </em></small></p>\n<p id=\"pUW2Sc\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review\">Kobo Libra Colour</a> is an excellent alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, especially for readers outside the US or anyone who doesn’t want to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem. Kobo’s latest slate offers many of the standout features found on the 11th-gen Kindle Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C support, and a 300ppi display — along with a few perks that make it more helpful and enjoyable to use.</p>\n<p id=\"A1W1W6\">The color display is the most obvious. The Libra Colour uses E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which provides soothing, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. It’s not as sharp as reading in monochrome — the resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing content in color — but it’s a nice touch that makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant. Book covers and comics, while still muted, have an added layer of depth, even if the colors are nowhere near as vivid as that of a traditional LED tablet.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TH-BeoqLDo_4-j1kSJq7lK5LFfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25494702/247144_best_ebook_reader_SVasani_0002.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption>Thanks to its physical page-turning buttons and color display, the Kobo Libra Colour is an impressive e-reader.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"VkOMKE\">Additionally, the Libra Colour works with the Kobo Stylus 2 (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-stylus-2&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23769068%2Fbest-ebook-readers\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sold separately</a>), which means you can highlight text with various colors or take notes using Kobo’s integrated notebooks. You can also take advantage of some of the more advanced capabilities found in the Kobo Elipsa 2E, allowing you to solve math equations, convert handwriting into typed text, and insert diagrams. This lets the Libra Colour function as a mini notebook of sorts, though I wouldn’t use it as a primary note-taking device since the seven-inch display can feel cramped to write on.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"e7gm0c\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to send books to your Kindle — even if they’re not from Amazon\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23842102/kindle-amazon-import-files-epub\"},{\"title\":\"That fancy color E Ink looks neat under a microscope\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137074/that-fancy-color-e-ink-looks-neat-under-a-microscope\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"wwJQuz\">The color display is only part of the appeal, though. The Libra Colour also lacks lockscreen ads — unlike the base Paperwhite — and packs physical page-turning buttons, which feel more intuitive to use than tapping either side of the display. The speedy e-reader also supports more file formats, including EPUB files, and makes it much easier to borrow books from the Overdrive library system. Native support for Pocket, meanwhile, means you can read your articles offline if you’re someone who uses the long-standing bookmarking app.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"An image of an outstretched hand stuffing a Kobo Libra Colour into a green-and-white purse.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opnei3_to7mnp9PwNqdS8iuqjjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25510981/Kobo_Libra_Colour_Lifestyle_Image.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Kobo</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>Kobo’s lightweight Libra Colour makes for a great ebook reader, even if it’s not the cheapest model.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"VnDBcn\">However, at $219.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required for performing certain tasks. That gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which it regularly is. There’s also the fact that the Kobo can’t easily tap into Amazon’s vast library of ebooks, which can be frustrating if you’ve amassed a collection of Kindle titles over the years. It can be done, but you have to convert file formats using third-party apps, which is tricky and can take time.</p>\n<p id=\"Rr9Hos\">But if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Kobo Libra Colour will give you the best digital reading experience of all the e-readers on our list. It’s my personal favorite, if nothing else.</p>\n<h4 id=\"0JIBBD\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review\">Read our Kobo Libra Colour review.</a></h4>\n<h2 id=\"5hvl2N\">The best cheap ebook reader</h2>\n<div id=\"VxqS55\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11942146\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"layout\":\"full_layout\"}'></div></div>\n<p id=\"3Nvaff\"><small><em><strong>Dimensions: </strong></em></small><small><em>6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches</em></small><small><em><strong> </strong></em></small><small><em>/ </em></small><small><em><strong>Weight: </strong></em></small><small><em>158 grams / </em></small><small><em><strong>Screen area and resolution</strong></em></small><small><em>: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / </em></small><small><em><strong>Storage:</strong></em></small><small><em> 16GB / </em></small><small><em><strong>Other features: </strong></em></small><small><em>USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support </em></small></p>\n<p id=\"NMhPgW\">The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR67MQLG/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">base-model Kindle</a> ($99.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it even has USB-C for relatively fast charging. </p>\n<p id=\"FTwNT7\">Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindle-kids-includes-access-to-thousands-of-books/dp/B0B4GC9TJT?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">kids version</a> Amazon sells for $20 more. It shares the same exact specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also comes with one year of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of kids books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to pay $79 per year.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A child holding and reading a pink Kindle while sitting on grass.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXebxN3CcCfZiudp-5uBD3ukxp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24079874/Amazon_Kindle_Kids_2022_Lifestyle_Press_Image.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Kindle Kids</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The kid-friendly version of the Kindle comes with colorful cases.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"2cov14\">The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the physical page-turning buttons found on Barnes &amp; Noble’s entry-level e-reader, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23188252/barnes-noble-nook-glowlight-4e-e-reader-ebook-review\">Nook GlowLight 4e</a>. However, you do get something more important: snappier responses. On most of the other entry-level ebook readers I tested, including the GlowLight 4e, I had to wait a few seconds after tapping the screen for the page to turn. The Kindle, in comparison, offered no perceptive lag.</p>\n<p id=\"t2sVdQ\">There are other tradeoffs. There’s no water resistance, unlike the Paperwhite, and battery life is good, but it’ll last you three weeks tops — not months, like the Paperwhite. And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to get rid of ads. But if you can do without all of that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $100.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UfYbWe\">\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23409106/amazon-kindle-2022-e-reader-review-test-price-specs-features\">Read our Kindle review</a>.</h4>\n<h2 id=\"zA7FKv\">The best ebook reader for taking notes</h2>\n<div id=\"ggTm1A\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11942148\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"layout\":\"full_layout\"}'></div></div>\n<p id=\"cIY1Og\"><small><em><strong>Dimensions: </strong></em></small><small><em>7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / </em></small><small><em><strong>Weight: </strong></em></small><small><em>390 grams / </em></small><small><em><strong>Screen area and resolution</strong></em></small><small><em>: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / </em></small><small><em><strong>Storage:</strong></em></small><small><em> 32GB / </em></small><small><em><strong>Other features: </strong></em></small><small><em>Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support </em></small></p>\n<p id=\"M6VQhW\">Of all the large ebook readers I tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because of its excellent note-taking abilities. You can directly write on pages, and the notes will not disappear, which makes for a more intuitive note-taking experience than the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23484927/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-notetaking-pen-review\">Kindle Scribe</a>, which only supports on-page notes on select Kindle titles. Otherwise, you’re limited to making annotations on cards that are like disappearing sticky notes. </p>\n<p id=\"D0dAzE\">You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online, and Kobo can even convert handwriting to typed text. Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23729817/amazon-kindle-scribe-kobo-elipsa-2e-e-reader-stylus-digital-notebook\">rolled out</a> a similar capability for the Kindle Scribe, but it can only convert handwriting to typed text when you export notebooks and not as accurately. By contrast, Kobo lets you convert your handwriting not just while exporting but also<em> </em>from within a notebook itself.</p>\n<div id=\"dNQjRw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11943282\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"54qUXP\">The Elipsa 2E also offers other helpful note-taking tools. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. There’s also a great selection of pen types and ink shades. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"mO6UHW\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Is E Ink finally ready for prime time?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23954584/e-ink-color-tablets-ereader\"},{\"title\":\"The Boox Palma is an amazing gadget I didn’t even know I wanted\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24184777/boox-palma-e-ink-smartphone-reader\"},{\"title\":\"The Playdate makes a surprisingly good e-reader\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24191461/playdate-ereader-app-playbook-panic-teenage-engineering\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"5GDSsP\">True, the Kindle Scribe starts at $60 less, but the Kobo Elipsa 2E comes with twice the storage. You <em>can</em> step up to the 32GB Kindle Scribe if you want the same storage capacity, but that puts it at essentially the same price as the Kobo. I recommend just forking out the money on the Elipsa 2E instead.</p>\n<p id=\"L9nAm3\">I also recommend the Elipsa 2E over the Onyx Boox Note Air 2 Plus, even though it, too, offers much better writing tools than the Kindle Scribe. That’s because it costs a whopping $449 and also isn’t as readily available in the US market. The Onyx Boox Note Air 2 Plus also comes with too many distracting extras, like an easy-to-access music player and the Google Play app store preinstalled so you can download multiple reading apps, including both the Kindle and Kobo apps. However, Kindle and Kobo notes didn’t show up on the Onyx Boox Note Air 2 Plus — and you can’t annotate their books anywhere as easily as you can on their respective devices.</p>\n<div id=\"kvBoxP\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11943287\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"FFMu3K\">Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader, but it comes with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo e-readers. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen does balance things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not really a noticeable drawback. </p>\n<h2 id=\"KmWfUt\">Other ebook readers that didn’t make the cut</h2>\n<p id=\"7xVk7S\">There are some other ebook readers I tested that I didn’t feature above but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable: </p>\n<h3 id=\"esAlmz\"><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-colour&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23769068%2Fbest-ebook-readers\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kobo Clara Colour</a></h3>\n<p id=\"wgTUVs\">If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review\">Kobo Clara Colour</a> — the successor to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle\">Kobo Clara 2E</a> — is worth a look. At $149.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle\">Kobo Clara 2E</a> (which you can still buy), but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. Plus, it’s noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point.</p>\n<h3 id=\"XiTXz5\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Mobile-ePaper-G-Sensor/dp/B0CQ7VRNFS/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Boox Palma</a></h3>\n<p id=\"3N11B3\">I’m currently waiting to get my hands on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Mobile-ePaper-G-Sensor/dp/B0CQ7VRNFS/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$280 Boox Palma</a>, which my colleague David Pierce <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24184777/boox-palma-e-ink-smartphone-reader\">is a big fan of</a>. The smartphone-sized, 6.1-inch ebook reader runs on Android and can access the Google Play Store, meaning you can download a wider selection of apps, from Amazon’s own Kindle app to various note-taking apps. That said, it’s too slow to really use apps that could be distracting, like TikTok or Instagram, so you probably don’t need to worry about losing focus or distractions in the same you would with a tablet or a more capable device. I’m curious to see how it holds up against other e-readers I’ve used, even if I haven’t tested many small-screen models.</p>\n<h3 id=\"n8mZDc\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23803227/barnes-and-nobles-forthcoming-e-reader-a-new-kindle-alternative\">Nook Glowlight 4 Plus</a></h3>\n<p id=\"32r6mC\">In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23803227/barnes-and-nobles-forthcoming-e-reader-a-new-kindle-alternative\">Nook Glowlight 4 Plus</a>. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-plus-barnes-noble/1143603294\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus</a> is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1sDh90\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display\">Kindle Oasis</a></h3>\n<p id=\"INEHAY\">Finally, I didn’t mention the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display\">Kindle Oasis</a>, which has physical page-turning buttons, a larger screen, and was considered a high-end device when it launched in 2019. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=6669702011&amp;ref=MARS_NAV_desktop_kindl_shopdvcs&amp;\">Amazon no longer lists the aging e-reader in its official Kindle lineup</a>, however, and it lacks some features even the base model offers, including USB-C.

Among them is an ultrapremium soundbar that will serve as a successor to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features\">current Sonos Arc</a> — and likely at a higher price. Codenamed Lasso, the device is currently in limited beta testing, and today, I can share the first images of it. </p>\n<p id=\"wlOyG3\">The exterior of the Lasso soundbar bears a strong resemblance to the Arc, which Sonos <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248430/sonos-arc-dolby-atmos-soundbar-announced-features-price-date\">introduced over four years ago</a>. But inside, the components and speaker drivers have been completely overhauled and redesigned, and that’s expected to result in a cost upwards of $1,200. Sonos aims to ship Lasso later this year, though the timeframe could change.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A photo of the upcoming Sonos soundbar, codename Lasso.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ms656dfU6P_zLZfoyvkpVS5U_cA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25525474/lassofront.jpeg\">\n      <cite>Image: The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>Yep, the Lasso soundbar has a very similar design to the Arc. If it ain’t broke...</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"Xjic77\">Whenever it does arrive, Lasso (hardware model S45) will be the first Sonos product to integrate technology from Mayht, a Netherlands-based startup that <a href=\"https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2022/Sonos-Announces-Acquisition-of-Mayht-Holding-BV/\">the company acquired in 2022</a> for $100 million in cash. At the time, Sonos credited Mayht for having “invented a new, revolutionary approach to audio transducers.” CEO Patrick Spence said the deal would give Sonos “more incredible people, technology, and intellectual property that will further distinguish the Sonos experience, enhance our competitive advantage, and accelerate our future roadmap.”</p>\n<p id=\"mLwgGt\">But it’s taken quite some time to get Mayht’s ideas into a shipping product. Sonos has released several small speakers over the last couple years — the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23656561/sonos-era-100-speaker-review-features\">Era 100</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23877274/sonos-move-2-review\">Move 2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161177/sonos-roam-2-bluetooth-speaker-now-available-features\">Roam 2</a> among them — that could’ve benefitted from Mayht’s innovative transducers, which are said to “enable smaller and lighter form factors without compromising on quality.” But it’s the soundbar that will offer the first taste of what the acquisition has yielded. Sources tell me that it’s been a challenge to make Mayht’s transducer system more cost efficient, as it partly makes use of “expensive” neodymium magnets.</p>\n<p id=\"LJOwMc\"><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/sonos-plans-400-500-headphones-tv-set-top-box-video-roam-2-new-sound-bar\"><em>Bloomberg</em> previously reported</a> the Lasso codename, its rumored price, and the inclusion of Mayht’s technology. The product’s final consumer branding isn’t yet known, but for now, Sonos is playfully including the <em>Ted Lasso</em> typeface on beta units.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"An image showing the Lasso codename on Sonos’ next soundbar.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aLUV0g6N6UUydPyEEg-qcAXuvlY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25525524/lasso.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>Lasso is the soundbar’s codename — not the final consumer branding.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"QOCVof\">The Arc is already a very impressive Dolby Atmos soundbar, and you can expect even greater immersion from Lasso and its revamped internals. Additionally, according to sources, the upcoming soundbar should deliver substantially better bass performance than its predecessor. With the Arc, you really need to add a Sub or Sub Mini to get the most out of it. Sonos could maybe get away with that with a $899 product, but if it’s going to charge well over $1,000 for Lasso, the device needs to deliver top-tier home theater audio without any added help.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A photo showing the back inputs of the upcoming Sonos soundbar.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7f6BdaCuA5V4nCdisUe0YvQ4ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25525470/lassoback.jpeg\">\n      <cite>Image: The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The new soundbar will support Bluetooth audio playback, something that the Arc does not.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"VtCK2t\">The images also reveal a dedicated Bluetooth button, suggesting that Lasso could support Bluetooth audio playback. That feature has been absent from all previous Sonos soundbars. And similar to the company’s other recent products, there’ll be a physical switch for disabling the built-in microphones. </p>\n<p id=\"Qiqxgh\">Just like the Arc, Lasso is designed to work with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24169086/sonos-ace-headphones-review\">the recently released Sonos Ace headphones</a> for private listening with spatial audio. The company has pledged to extend Ace compatibility to its more affordable Beam and Ray soundbars by late summer or early fall.</p>\n<div><div id=\"WwgUHV\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:12374748\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"A8pnBK\">As for the more immediate future, Sonos continues to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1cwghm0/future_feature_updates_and_known_issues_live/\">release updates</a> to its mobile app at a frequent pace as it tries to address customer frustrations and lift the negative sentiment that has embroiled the company’s community since May. </p>\n<p id=\"3r5jMr\">It’s clear to me that Sonos is listening and moving quickly, but a lot of damage has already been done: the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonos.acr2&amp;hl=en_US\">Android version</a> of the Sonos app currently has a brutal 1.2-star average review rating. The rating on Apple’s App Store isn’t nearly as bad since older reviews are still balancing out <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162168/sonos-ceo-patrick-spence-new-app-design-interview\">the spate of complaints</a> that came with the redesign. </p>"

Open the main app (or apps) you use to control your gadgets, and from there, create a list of everything you have installed. </p>\n<p id=\"nJB67g\">You can use a home inventory app or just a good old-fashioned spreadsheet. I recommend using a smart home backup app such as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/homepass-for-homekit-matter/id1330266650\">HomePass for HomeKit &amp; Matter</a> (iOS only). This will list all your gadgets by room and store their HomeKit, Matter, or any other numerical codes you might need if you have to set them up again in your new home. I’ve not found an Android alternative, but a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho\">password manager</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://1password.com/downloads/mac/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Password</a> should work.</p>\n<p id=\"6Ik0JN\">This is also a good time to collate passwords and usernames for any apps you use to manage devices and gather instruction manuals, whether physical or by downloading PDFs. Once you have a complete list, go through it and decide what you plan to leave, what will come with you, and finally, what you will need to purchase for your new home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"85LCle\">Should it stay or should it go? </h2>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRH92BQGChpnOhp2RO9gSYVKjCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24037390/226281_YALE_ASSURE_SMART_LOCK_2_jtuohy_0009.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>You’ll need to decide if you want to take devices like smart locks and video doorbells with you.

They may not trust you’ve fully reset a smart lock or don’t still have access to that video doorbell. But with the right steps, selling your home with its smart gear intact is possible. In some cases — particularly smart lighting and smart thermostats — you may find that your gadgets can increase your home’s value or be used in negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"Z0FDaE\">In broad terms, it’s expected that fixtures of the home — anything wired or screwed in — should stay, and anything plugged in or battery-powered should come with you or be sold, donated, or recycled if you no longer want it. If you choose to take something with you that’s technically a fixture, such as those listed below, either put it in the <a href=\"https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/inclusions-exclusions\">inclusion / exclusion</a> section of your listing so prospective buyers are aware or swap it out before you show your home. </p>\n<div>\n<div id=\"kn7k7u\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:12362615\"></div></div>\n<div id=\"p1lMc4\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:12362616\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"LlVv8D\">How to transfer ownership of your smart home gadgets</h2>\n<p id=\"dAI1D2\">If you’ve negotiated to leave any of your smart devices behind, make it clear in your sale that you are leaving them “as is.” You don’t want to be on the hook as a sysadmin for the new residents. </p>\n<p id=\"DYJSGh\">However, as a courtesy and to ease a buyer’s possible fears, I recommend setting up a dedicated email address for your home and transferring those devices to that email address. (This will mean factory-resetting them or transferring / sharing ownership to the email.) </p>\n<p id=\"1DImWi\">When the sale closes, hand over the email address and password to the new owner. Then, go in and remove yourself from any device and delete them from your app (or delete the app if you don’t have any other devices from that company). Do this before you leave since some devices will not let you perform a factory reset unless you are on the same network.</p>\n<p id=\"bGnn0w\">The new owner can use the email address to transfer device ownership to themselves and set up new accounts and passwords, all without bothering you. </p>\n<p id=\"iPnliX\"><em>Tip: Before you factory-reset or transfer a device, remove any smart home integrations, such as with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, or IFTTT.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Owz1Mv\">Using a service like Gmail means you can also create a Google Drive folder with PDFs of all the manuals and a Google Doc listing the devices and their brands, model names, and any other pertinent details the new owner might need. </p>\n<p id=\"rKyhOY\">As mentioned, you must either factory-reset or transfer every device you leave in the house. However, consider how you treat each device carefully to ensure you don’t “break” the home. If you factory-reset a thermostat, it will no longer work, which could cause damage to the home in extreme temperatures. The same goes for a smart sprinkler system — you don’t want to be on the hook for a new lawn. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzCsHjj1QsAOfEjjStm055nkEZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23470744/jtuohy_220511_5218_0006.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>If you plan to take your smart thermostat with you, make sure you install a replacement and ensure it’s working correctly so you don’t cause any damage to the HVAC system.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"8TUDsE\">To ensure critical systems stay functional for the new owner, check with the device manufacturer for steps on how to factory-reset and / or transfer ownership. Additionally, security devices like cameras, security systems, and smart locks often require <a href=\"https://ring.com/support/articles/k8jn9/transfer-device-ownership\">special steps</a>, which are designed to make sure no one can take over your account without your permission. If you factory-reset them without following these steps, you could leave the new owner with a dead gadget. </p>\n<p id=\"shwHnM\">All of this is why the house email address makes a lot of sense. The new owner can still control and use the devices while they get settled and then easily factory-reset it themselves and transfer permissions to their own email, giving them more confidence that you’ve been fully erased. </p>\n<p id=\"Z36DMZ\"><em>Tip: If you are leaving security cameras behind, make sure you also remove or wipe any storage systems, such as microSD cards or cloud backup, and cancel any subscriptions. </em></p>\n<div><div id=\"mrjjbu\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:12362611\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 id=\"oTSuvx\">How to pack up your smart home gear</h2>\n<p id=\"1hrBD6\">For devices you are taking with you, be as methodical as you can about packing things up. As you uninstall devices, place them in their original packaging or containers like a Ziplock bag to keep everything together, such as screws, stands, remotes, etc. Label the bag’s contents with the device name, room, and location. This will make it much easier to set everything back up in your new home.</p>\n<p id=\"iIgfHV\">Do not factory-reset these devices. Just unplug them and pack them away, and remove any batteries if you still have some time before the move.

For decades, they’ve been used to make products more resistant to water, stains, and heat. More recently, a particular subclass of PFAS called bis-perfluoroalkyl sulfonimides (bis-FASIs) has been used as electrolytes and binders in lithium-ion batteries. </p>\n<p id=\"tVMKBw\">Those bis-FASIs are now showing up in soil, sediment, water, and snow surrounding manufacturing facilities, according to research published yesterday in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>. The study authors also found bis-FASIs in liquids that leached from landfills. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"pfOPLT\"><q>It’s a problem that could grow as more pieces of our lives become all-electric — from cars to homes and buildings</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"HZQirS\">Taken together, it points to lithium-ion batteries as a potential vector for forever chemical pollution from cradle to grave. Without taking action, it’s a problem that could grow as more pieces of our lives become all-electric — from cars to homes and buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"H5UeSC\">“It’s definitely not intended to be anti-clean or sustainable energy ... It’s really meant to highlight, ‘Hey, let’s include environmental risk assessments of the things that we’re using in this infrastructure,’” says lead author Jennifer Guelfo, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at Texas Tech University.</p>\n<p id=\"CD4JTl\">“It’s basically a starting point. And what I hope is that it leads to more attention to these compounds and others like them in applications that are emerging in both clean energy as well as consumer electronics,” adds P. Lee Ferguson, another study author and an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Duke University.</p>\n<p id=\"euDfSb\">The researchers took water, sediment, and soil samples from 87 different locations in Minnesota, Kentucky, Belgium, and France between January and October 2022 — targeting areas near forever chemical manufacturers including 3M and Arkema, among others. They found concentrations of bis-FASIs in the parts per billion (ppb) common near manufacturing facilities. “You don’t just find that out there typically as like background concentration,” Guelfo says. “Parts per billion is usually something that’s associated with some form of impact.”</p>\n<p id=\"SNe2i2\">For comparison, that’s less PFAS contamination than you might find in the environment from a release of fire-fighting foam, according to Guelfo. PFAS levels might be in the parts per million in that scenario, about a thousand times higher than the bis-FASI concentrations Guelfo and her colleagues typically found near manufacturers. But the contamination they documented is still orders of magnitude higher than <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24125488/epa-pfas-forever-chemicals-drinking-water-standards\">limits the Environmental Protection Agency set this year</a> for other kinds of PFAS in drinking water. The agency’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard\">limit</a> is four parts per trillion for two of the most common types of forever chemicals. </p>\n<p id=\"uETzXE\">There aren’t any federal regulations yet for bis-FASIs in particular, which haven’t been used as ubiquitously as other kinds of PFAS for as long. Because PFAS has been used in everything from <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/02/so-are-nonstick-pans-safe-or-what/672965/\">nonstick pans</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/us/pfas-chemicals-fast-food.html\">food packaging</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/20/23518630/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-phase-out\">fabric protector</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/dental-floss-harmful-chemicals/\">dental floss</a> — certain types of PFAS have likely already entered <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/us-population.html\">most Americans’ bloodstreams</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"FxlTno\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The US finalizes rules for ‘forever chemicals’ in drinking water \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24125488/epa-pfas-forever-chemicals-drinking-water-standards\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"v6aXf4\">Scientists are still trying to understand how exposure to PFAS affects people, and even less is known about bis-FASIs specifically. But studies on more common types of PFAS have <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html\">linked</a> high exposure to a higher risk of certain kinds of cancer, liver damage, high cholesterol, and reproductive health issues including lower infant birth weight. Bis-FASIs are likely to persist for a long time in the environment, the new research suggests, but could potentially be cleaned up using similar methods for treating other kinds of forever chemicals in drinking water.</p>\n<p id=\"cFboVF\">Since there are so many different kinds of PFAS and mounting concerns about the risks they pose as a class of chemicals, the researchers say we might not want to wait to find problems later on if we can take measures now to protect health and the environment. 3M, which faces a slew of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pfas-drinking-water-settlement-3m-fa41cadfe0d65b9723377a681df43af1\">lawsuits</a> for producing PFAS over the years, has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/20/23518630/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-phase-out\">committed to phasing out forever chemicals</a> by the end of next year and continuing to clean up pollution near its facilities afterwards. That includes no longer manufacturing bis-FASIs, the company tells<em> The Verge </em>in an email. Arkema didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"UbhmtW\">“I would argue that we should take a proactive stance in terms of mitigating environmental releases of PFAS instead of waiting until we have done decades of toxicology research to say, ‘Hey, maybe we should mitigate this in drinking water,’” Guelfo says.</p>\n<p id=\"fDOj5t\">What’s more, lithium-ion batteries are becoming even <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/battery-2030-resilient-sustainable-and-circular\">more in demand</a> for EVs and solar and wind power. The study authors tested 17 different batteries used in laptops, smartphones, tablets, electric vehicles, and more and detected bis-FASIs in 11 of them. And since it’s estimated that only around 5 percent of lithium-ion batteries are recycled, they decided to look near landfills for bis-FASIs, too. They analyzed existing lab samples of leachates collected from North Carolina landfills and found concentrations nearing the parts per billion range.</p>\n<p id=\"Bw4DY4\">“This is a very interesting study from a group of very-qualified investigators,” A. Daniel Jones, associate director at the Michigan State University Center for PFAS Research who was not involved in the research, said in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. “This work draws attention to an often-neglected PFAS chemical and suggests that it is readily transported through the environment. It is also important that this study draws attention to the need for greater awareness of the implications of the full life cycles of lithium batteries.”</p>"

It’s just too bad that those moments are few and far between.</p>\n<p id=\"5NBKEu\"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is the latest game from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777194/genshin-impact-fanfiction-merchandise-rules-creators\"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/24/23695826/honkai-star-rail-release-date-trailer-pre-install\"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as MiHoYo). It combines action RPG combat with gacha game mechanics (<a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gacha\">gacha</a> referring to the type of game where characters and resources are doled out randomly via loot boxes and other kinds of microtransactions). The game takes place in a futuristic urban setting where you play as a Proxy who controls a bangboo to guide your team of operators through a hollow to complete commissions taken from the inter-knot. And though this seems like a string of incomprehensible garbage, this is actually the easiest part of the game to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"jZFCYD\">Commissions work like daily quests and are categorized as to whether they’re story, combat, or exploration missions. No matter what type of mission it is, though, it seems like they all follow the same basic structure. First is the exploration part. The screen turns into a giant wall of TVs that you move your little rabbit avatar (called a bangboo... seriously) across to reach the goal. It looks kinda like a board game, with each TV representing some kind of event. Some TVs will have resources to pick up, while others hide combat encounters. If you run into a combat TV, the game changes, dropping your party into an arena with a bunch of monsters to fight.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Screenshot from Zenless Zone Zero featuring a wall of TVs arranged in a grid fashion with a rabbit displayed on one of the screens.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaTlgnG-WqAe-ZUxjz5wRK58VBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25528180/1000008606.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Hoyoverse</cite>\n      <figcaption>\n<em>An example of </em>Zenless Zone Zero<em>’s exploration minigame.</em>\n</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"YAwc0T\">Usually, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GE_KeYdxG2A?si=VwCdy2HoUnOdktG-\">highly polished, action-filled trailers</a> of most free-to-play games conceal actual gameplay <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/BScFjetm_B0?si=M9jynaNI6YusdZpq\">that’s either nothing like the trailer</a> or nothing more than a mindless clickfest. So, I was not prepared for how engaging <em>ZZZ</em>’s combat really is. It’s fast and fluid, with a bunch of different actions you can string together to execute slick-as-hell combos. Add to that the ability to switch to any one of your party members mid-combo, and it makes for an experience that could stand next to any blockbuster action RPG game. It’s a hoot landing a dodge just right to chain together devastating attacks from each party member again and again. Pure gas.</p>\n<div id=\"qd2WTJ\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-b_37whBVvA?rel=0&amp;start=492\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"xoqyw9\">But for some reason, the game is determined to keep that gas away from me as much as possible. There are so many other elements to the game that interfere with what’s most fun. While I appreciate that you can visit a noodle shop where the food buffs your party and that there’s an arcade with little minigames you can play with your party, it all feels like too much fluff. All I want to do is lead my little bangboo around collecting items and fight monsters with my party members, and all the game<em> </em>wants me to do is run a Blockbuster — really. </p>\n<p id=\"DpBQW6\">Why am I running a Blockbuster? I have no idea, and I’ve given up trying to figure it out. The game’s insistence on throwing so much at you upfront and its inability to explain anything coherently are so bad that I don’t even know how the gacha mechanics work. </p>\n<p id=\"QYju2x\">Each combat mission comes with information like the type of enemies you’ll face and their weaknesses, while your party members have their own unique abilities and affinities. The appeal, then, is to acquire as many different operators to mix and match your party so you’ll have the right tool for each job. There are scores of interestingly designed characters — like the superhot wolfman with ice powers and an exquisitely tailored waistcoat — that I don’t know how to acquire because I’m still busy fussing with what movies to rent out at my Blockbuster. </p>\n<div id=\"ZE4pFr\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OqyvAXbgiQ?rel=0\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"t26SGq\">Maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe HoYoverse is trying to curtail <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/10/06/genshin-impact-gambling/\">the criticisms a lot of gacha games get</a> for being naked cash grabs by obscuring the function of its microtransactions to all but the most motivated of spenders. I can see the shop, but where I’m at in the way-too-long tutorial, I don’t have the faintest idea of how to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"L182NJ\">I recognize that as video game trends evolve while I get older, there will be some games that I’ll never be able to comprehend. Despite my best intentions and as open a mind as I could muster, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is that game. And if I don’t get that wolfman soon, I’m content to leave the game for the people who get it.</p>\n<p id=\"Gc0T0b\"><small><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></small><small> is available now on Android, iOS, PC, and PlayStation.</small></p>"

An aluminum edition is coming out this month, and the company says that the new handhelds “areprecision CNC’d entirely in aluminum.” They come in four colors — natural, noir, black, and indigo — and will be <a href=\"https://store.analogue.co/\">available to preorder</a> on July 15th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, with units expected to ship on July 17th.</p>\n<p id=\"lO4Yiv\">That metal body doesn’t come cheap, though. The aluminum Pocket will cost $499, a big boost over the $219 of the standard version. Analogue says that the new version will be “available in highly limited quantities and will never be sold again.”</p>\n<p id=\"RuTgr2\">Here’s a look at all the aluminum parts of the device:</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A photo of Analogue Pocket parts made from aluminum.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WieQd-xPoWICSrb85cK4xKoIOfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25528089/2_AP_Aluminum_LE___parts.png\">\n      <cite>Image: Analogue</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"dNMETL\">Since its launch in 2021, Analogue has released a handful of other special editions of the Pocket, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23961099/analogue-pocket-special-edition-classic-colors-gameboy-advance\">some bright colors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848739/analogue-pocket-glow-in-the-dark-preorders\">a glow-in-the-dark version</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23888931/analogue-pocket-transparent-price-release-date\">the always-popular transparent shell</a>. The device allows gamers to play old Game Boy cartridges (as well as other carts, with the right adapters) on a handheld with modern touches like a crisp LCD screen.</p>\n<p id=\"8SeOsq\">The Pocket was the company’s first handheld device after previously releasing high-quality recreations of consoles like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review\">NES</a> (which also came in aluminum), <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review\">SNES</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date\">Sega Genesis</a>. Up next is the Nintendo 64 with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64\">the Analogue 3D</a>, which was originally planned for a 2024 release.</p>"

Best Buy is <a href=\"https://howl.me/cmEnZjZvE2J\">currently accepting orders</a> for the limited-edition console for $209.99 ahead of its September 26th release date.

The noble house’s signature crest graces the rear, and you’ll find a smaller Triforce symbol stamped on the front in the lower-right corner. There’s not much more setting it apart from any other Switch Lite, but considering <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is the first <em>Zelda</em> title to actually star Princess Zelda as the primary character, the occasion may move you to pick it up even if you already own Nintendo’s dedicated handheld.</p>\n<p id=\"hpl04e\">Nintendo’s premium subscription tier, meanwhile, provides access to online play, cloud-based saves, and the ability to play older classics from the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, NES, SNES, N64, and even the Sega Genesis eras.

However, it can’t connect to TVs or play titles that require detachable Joy-Con controllers. At 5.5 inches, the kickstand-less handheld is also lighter and smaller than its hybrid siblings, rendering it a better option if you want something to entertain yourself while traveling. The display shares the same resolution as the standard model, but it appears sharper given the reduced size; it also features better controls thanks to the inclusion of a proper directional pad. </p>\n<div id=\"DxhE1U\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12085975\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"cMJfOf\">It’s worth mentioning that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024\">Nintendo plans to release a so-called “Switch 2” next year</a>.

The Xbox maker has started emailing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers warning of a price increase to $19.99 a month that starts on September 12th, a $3 increase over the current $16.99 a month pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"EmSwdQ\">PC Game Pass subscribers will also see a price hike in September, with the service moving from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and maintaining access to day-one titles. If you’re outside the US and wondering how the price increases affect your own subscription, Microsoft has a full list of all the <a href=\"https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf\">worldwide price changes here</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"BJOeDy\">The <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024\">price increases</a> come just before Microsoft plans to add <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and other big first-party Xbox games to its Game Pass service later this year. The price increases will largely affect Ultimate subscribers who make up the vast majority of Game Pass subscribers and come just over a year after the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase\">last Game Pass price hikes</a> raised rates by $1–$2 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"xE25St\">Alongside the Ultimate and PC Game Pass price hikes, Microsoft will also offer a new option of an Xbox Game Pass Standard subscription without day-one titles that will be priced at $14.99 per month for new users to the service. The existing Xbox Game Pass for console subscription will continue for existing subscribers, but new Game Pass subscribers won’t be able to select the console option starting July 10th until the new Game Pass Standard subscription is available. Microsoft says Xbox Game Pass Standard “will be available in the coming months.”</p>\n<p id=\"5D2gi4\">The new standard option also include online console multiplayer access, which is something that Xbox Game Pass for Console lacked previously. Existing Xbox Game Pass for Console subscribers will only be able to stack for up to 13 months from September 18th, but this won’t impact existing stacks.</p>\n<p id=\"9CWoaI\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans\">I revealed in May</a> that Microsoft was considering raising Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pricing again, amid a debate around adding <em>Call of Duty </em>to the service. A price increase to the top tier will help offset Microsoft adding Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> series to Game Pass, and it has been largely expected since Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass\">made the <em>CoD </em>addition official</a>.</p>\n<aside id=\"4nuD62\"><div data-anthem-component=\"actionbox\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"title\":\"Notepad by Tom Warren\",\"description\":\"A weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft’s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.\",\"label\":\"Subscribe\",\"url\":\"http://theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter\"}'></div></aside>"

There’s a mix of new and classic boards and games to enjoy, all of which are completely playable with just a single Joy-Con per player (including a sizable amount that use the controllers’ motion capabilities).

You have iconic mainstays like Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Princess Peach, of course, but you’ll also find characters from popular series like <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Splatoon</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. You can earn several unique dice blocks for each with special abilities or improved odds to roll the numbers you need. </p>\n<p id=\"etcfhA\">To win, you’ll need to acquire more stars than your opponents before the turn or time limit expires. As you move across the board, you’ll claim bonuses and powerups that may help you land on lucrative squares that can earn you more stars. You might also land on squares that aren’t so helpful to your plight.</p>\n<p id=\"9ugzG5\">Between the skill-based minigames, boosts and busts you can encounter on the board from random dice rolls, and last-minute swings that can completely turn the tide, no two games of <em>Super Mario Party</em> ever feel quite the same. Be careful playing with loved ones — there’s a good chance your friendly rivalries can turn a little bitter as you continually settle the score.</p>\n<aside id=\"C26u8V\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>"
